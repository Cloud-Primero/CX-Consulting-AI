You start by connecting to the person on the other side of the page ... the per son reading.\n\nBefore we go one step further, you need to understand this concept:\n\nCopywriting is a team sport.\n\nThere is YOU, the writer. And there is HIM or HER, the reader. Here's the deal: The reader gets to decide when the game is over. As soon as the reader is gone, nobody is reading your copy anymore. So you must anticipate what's going to keep them interested and intrigued with the copy ahead of time.\n\nFirst of all, when you want to connect with somebody, you have to know where they're coming from. Say you're interested in someone of the opposite sex; to get the best results, you're going to need to do a little research, right? Hopefully you· wouldn't just approach the object of your desire without knowing a bit more about him/ her. (That's why the movie \"Fatal Attraction\" was made.)\n\nThis goes the same with your target market for your business. You need to dig a little bit and do some research in order to get the best results. Here are some things you need to know.\n\nFor starters, you must know the education level of your target market to reach them effectively. In general, even educated people don't mind reading simple words. Simple means clear. But there's a fine line between talking down to your target market and using simple language. For example,\n\nInstead of \"at this point in time,\" write \"now.\" Instead of \"subsequent to,\" write \"after.\" Instead of \"on the grounds that,\" write \"because.\"\n\nPART THREE / Outside Influences: Guest Chapters\n\nUNCENSORED SALES S'fRA'fEGIES xu 225\n\nInstead of \"in spite of the fact that,\" write \"although.\" Instead of \"whether or not,\" write \"whether.\" Instead of \"make inquiry regarding,\" write \"inquire.\"\n\nYou get the idea. (Lawyers may not appreciate copywriting but your prospects will.) So anytime you can simplifY the language in your copy, by all means do it. You're not insulting your reader at all.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nHe’d ask one of 19 random questions. Examples included: “Based on your skills, what kind of world record do you think you could set?” or “What would your spirit animal be and why?” or “If you could do anything for a living, what would it be and why?” Consumers had 10 seconds to answer the question. The entire audition was captured and uploaded as a 15‐second video to YouTube and that consumer’s social networks—again, content being collected at live events and distributed everywhere else.\n\nBy August, it had become a phenomenon. Millennials chased the brand, begged for access to Whatever, USA, and shared more content than anyone had anticipated. More than 200,000 of them actually audi- tioned to get into Whatever, USA. In September, a final Last Call for Whatever event was held at 350 bars and nightclubs while the brand contacted, congratulated, validated, and booked 500 winners to go to Crested Butte, Colorado, which had been unveiled as the town that would be transformed into Whatever, USA.\n\nFor the entire summer, teams had been preparing the Colorado town for a transformation no brand had ever attempted before. Entire roads would be repaved; stores, restaurants, and hotels would be given makeovers; flight destinations would be altered. The logistics involved with getting the town to cooperate? Probably worthy of its own chapter. Some winners were notified via “selection day stunts” in which street teams hand‐deliv- ered larger‐than‐life Whatever, USA boarding passes to them while camera crews filmed and then uploaded the videos to YouTube. Each of the 500 winners could bring a friend, assuming they could get to their flights in less than 10 hours—they said they were up for whatever, right?\n\nSo three months and 22,000 events later, there was just one event left. Whatever, USA opened, serving as a bold finale to the summer pro- gram and a beacon to Millennials everywhere that the new Bud Light\n\n48 Experiential Marketing\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nThis email was sent on July 22, 2009.

We had rented out one of the ballrooms in a conference center near our offices.\n\nAnd then, a funny thing happened. We had prepped the managers of each\n\nof the departments earlier that morning to meet with their teams to answer any questions they may have about my e-mail. We had expected and planned for there to be no productivity for the rest of the day as our employees took in the news.\n\nAs predicted, employees were initially surprised by the news. As predicted, employees had questions. But within an hour of the announcement, our employees got right back to work, continuing whatever they had been doing earlier. Our merchandising team was busy making phone calls to our vendors and a handful of us were busy dealing with inquiries from the press. But other than that, for most people, it was back to business as usual. I was absolutely amazed.\n\nI had been worried that employees would be too shocked by the headline\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nIntegrity was a value that had been suggested by some employees, but I made a conscious choice to leave it out. I felt that integrity would come from us actually committing to and living up to our core values in everything we did, not just referring to them when it was convenient.\n\nOver time, our recruiting department developed interview questions for each and every one of the core values, and we tested our commitment during the hiring process.\n\nBe Humble is probably the core value that ends up affecting our hiring decisions the most. There are a lot of experienced, smart, and talented people we interview that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom line. But a lot of them are also really egotistical, so we end up not hiring them. At most companies, the hiring manager would probably argue that we should hire such a candidate because he or she will add a lot of value to the company, which is probably why most large corporations don’t have great cultures.\n\nOur philosophy at Zappos is that we’re willing to make short-term\n\nsacrifices (including lost revenue or profits) if we believe that the long-term benefits are worth it. Protecting the company culture and sticking to core values is a long-term benefit.\n\nOnce we had our final list of our ten core values, I sent an e-mail to the entire company describing each of them in more detail. We still refer to the original e-mail today. In fact, when new employees join the company, they are required to sign a document stating that they have read the core values document and understand that living up to the core values is part of their job expectation.\n\nZappos Core Values Document\n\nTHE ZAPPOS MISSION: To live and deliver WOW.\n\nAs we grow as a company, it has become more and more important to explicitly define the Zappos core values from which we develop our culture, our brand, and our business strategies. With so many new employees joining the company as we grow, we want to make sure that everyone is on the same page and acting consistently with what we want Zappos to be all about.\n\nOver time, we will be restructuring performance evaluations so that a big\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nOur publisher, O’Reilly, offered a pre-release version of this book as an ebook. Selected chapters were available for download from early 2016 on and we received feedback through the O’Reilly website, by email, and later also through tisdd.rocks. Our final draft was then sent out to invited experts from the service design community and beyond. They gave feedback on selected chapters and were invited to write comments, tips, or counter opinions, many of which are published under their own names next to the text. Finally, we invited 10 reviewers to read the whole manuscript end to end to review how the different parts fit together.\n\nOverall, we tried to practice what we preach and used an iterative, co- creative, and “reader”-centered design approach to create this book. As you can imagine, such a process is time consuming and hard to plan. We missed many deadlines and had to postpone the publishing date several times. Luckily, we have a publisher who believed in these ideas and supported us all the way. And even now, this book is not “finished.” It is just the beginning. It\n\nis a slightly less sh!tty first draft …\n\n– Your authors, Marc & Adam & Markus & Jakob\n\nWE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE 200+ REVIEWERS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO HELP US CO-CREATE THIS BOOK. YOU FOLKS ROCK!\n\nAdam Cochrane, Adriana Ojeda, Agnieszka Mróz, Ahmad Heshmat, Aimee Tasker, Alexander Staufer, Amy Barron, Ana Kyra Bekš, Ana Luis, Ana Osredkar, André Diniz de Moraes, Andreas Conradi, Andreas Kupfer, Anna Pfeifer, Anne Sofie Laursen, Ariane Fricke, Arthur Yeh, Barbara\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nHow This Book Is Structured\n\nThis book is divided into three sections.\n\nThe first section is titled “Profits” and consists mostly of stories of me growing up and eventually finding my way to Zappos. Some of the stories are about my early adventures as an entrepreneur, while others are about a younger version of me rebelling against what was expected.\n\nThe second section, “Profits and Passion,” is more business-oriented, covering many of the important philosophies that we believe in and live by at Zappos. I also share some of the internal e-mails and documents that we continue to use to this day.\n\nThe third section is titled “Profits, Passion, and Purpose.” It outlines our\n\nvision at Zappos for taking things to the next level, and will hopefully challenge you to do the same.\n\nThis book is not meant to be a comprehensive corporate history of Zappos or any of the previous businesses I’ve been involved in. It’s also not meant to be a complete autobiography. As such, I haven’t mentioned everyone who contributed or played a role in my life. (If I had, there would have been way too many names for readers to try to keep track of and remember.) The purpose of this book is to give some of the highlights of the path that I took in my journey toward discovering how to find happiness in business and in life.\n\nFinally, as you read through this book, you’ll probably notice some sentences that aren’t the best examples of English grammar. Except where third-party contributions to the book are specifically noted, I wrote this book without the use of a ghostwriter. I’m not a professional writer, and in many cases I purposely chose to do things that would probably make my high school English teachers cringe, such as ending a sentence with a preposition. I did this partly because I wanted the writing to reflect how I would normally talk, and partly just to annoy all my high school English teachers (who I appreciate dearly).\n\nAlthough I did not use a ghostwriter, many people helped out behind the scenes with feedback, suggestions, and encouragement, and I’m grateful for\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\n“We had a customer e-mail us the other day,” I said. “He had ordered a\n\npair of shoes that we had in our warehouse and we surprised him with a shipping upgrade so that he got his order in two days instead of our original promise of a week. He said he loved our customer service and would tell his friends and family about us. He even said we should one day start a Zappos Airlines.”\n\n“That’s pretty funny,” Fred said. “Have you read Good to Great by Jim Collins?” I asked. “No, is it a good book? I mean… is it a great book?” “Yeah, you should definitely read it,” I replied. “He talks about what separates the great companies from just the good ones over the long term. One of the things that he found from his research was that great companies have a greater purpose and bigger vision beyond just making money or being number one in a market. A lot of companies fall into the trap of just focusing on making money, and then they never become a great company.”\n\n“Well,” Fred replied, “making money would certainly be a nice problem\n\nfor us to have right now.”\n\n“We’ll get there. We just need to get through this year. We had a good phone call with Wells Fargo today, so maybe we can get a loan from them.”\n\n“What are the chances of that happening?” Fred asked. “It’s too early to tell. But at least they didn’t flat-out say no like all the\n\nother banks we tried to contact.”\n\nFred and I continued talking. On the one hand, we had to get through our short-term cash-flow challenges. On the other hand, we wanted to make sure we were thinking long-term and laying the foundation for the future of the company. We knew we couldn’t choose one over the other. We had to do both.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nDid the results surprise you? Very probably. Most of us think of ourselves as decent people who would rush to help in such a situation, and we expect other decent people to do the same. The point of the experiment, of course, was to show that this expectation is wrong. Even normal, decent people do not rush to help when they expect others to take on the unpleasantness of dealing with a seizure. And that means you, too.\n\nAre you willing to endorse the following statement? “When I read the procedure of the helping experiment I thought I would come to the stranger’s help immediately, as I probably would if I found myself alone with a seizure victim. I was probably wrong. If I find myself in a situation in which other people have an opportunity to help, I might not step forward. The presence of others would reduce my sense of personal responsibility more than I initially thought.” This is what a teacher of psychology would hope you would learn. Would you have made the same inferences by yourself?\n\nThe psychology professor who describes the helping experiment wants the students to view the low base rate as causal, just as in the case of the fictitious Yale exam. He wants them to infer, in both cases, that a surprisingly high rate of failure implies a very difficult test. The lesson students are meant to take away is that some potent feature of the situation, such as the diffusion of responsibility, induces normal and decent people such as them to behave in a surprisingly unhelpful way.\n\nChanging one’s mind about human nature is hard work, and changing one’s mind for the worse about oneself is even harder. Nisbett and Borgida suspected the that students would resist unpleasantness. Of course, the students would be able and willing to recite the details of the helping experiment on a test, and would even repeat the “official” interpretation in terms of diffusion of responsibility. But did their beliefs about human nature really change? To find out, Nisbett and Borgida showed them videos of brief interviews allegedly conducted with two people who had participated in the New York study. The interviews were short and bland. The interviewees appeared to be nice, normal, decent people. They described their hobbies, their spare-time activities, and their plans for the future, which were entirely conventional.
