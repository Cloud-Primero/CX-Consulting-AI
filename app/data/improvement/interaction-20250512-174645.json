Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:\n\n**1. It's Not About Direct ROI, But Value Creation:**  Instead of searching for a direct ROI figure, the focus should be on creating value for customers and ensuring that aligns with your brand. Consistent, positive customer experiences will ultimately lead to financial benefits, but that's a consequence, not the primary goal **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**2. Return on Customer (ROC) vs. ROI:**  A more appropriate metric is Return on Customer (ROC), which measures how efficiently you use your customers to create value. This involves understanding and analyzing customer lifetime values and customer equity **(Source: doc_4)**.  Traditional ROI measures capital efficiency; ROC measures customer efficiency.\n\n**3. The Pitfalls of Over-Focusing on ROI:**  Rushing to quantify ROI can lead to misguided efforts, like focusing solely on technology or neglecting intangible benefits that customers value.  For example, cleaning toilets and improving signage in a port might seem like a good investment, but if not tied to the overall customer experience, the ROI calculation can be flawed and the program killed **(Source: doc_5)**.\n\n**4.  CX is an Enabler, Not a Goal:** Customer experience isn't a goal in itself; it's an enabler that provides strategic options. Asking \"What's the ROI of customer experience?\" is like asking \"What's the ROI of having a phone?\" – it's about how you *use* the experience to create value **(Source: doc_6)**. A better question is, \"What is the ROI derived from the different ways of doing customer experience?\"\n\n**5.  Experiential Marketing ROI:**  Experiential marketing programs often realize an ROI of between 3:1 to 5:1, and 29% indicate a return over 10:1. Top measurement factors include attendance, social media activity, and lead generation **(Source: doc_9)**.\n\n**6.  Beyond Tangible Metrics:**  Recognizing the qualitative, subjective nature of customer experience is crucial.  Focusing solely on tangible metrics can miss the \"feel\" of the brand and the intangible benefits customers seek **(Source: doc_3)**.\n\n\n\nIn essence, while financial metrics are important, a customer-centric approach that prioritizes value creation and understands the nuances of customer experience is more likely to yield sustainable financial returns.",
  "context": "<source id=\"doc_1\" name=\"doc_1\">\nYou are not going to find ROI – but if you tell me what you are look- ing for from customers and the brand then the money will take care of itself. There is no difference in measuring the ROI of training staff than CX. But this is not a leap of faith, you can draw a line between CX improvements and finances without breaking this down to $; if you go down one path and it is better for customers, and you are consistent with the brand then your will be better than the competition.\n\nNPS has overstated the relationship to the health of finances for so\n\nlong; but it’s not the case all the time.\n\nTo me CX is still the most interesting thing happening/not happening today, fascinating!\n\nFootnotes\n\n1A cognitive assessment of experience is about intangible benefits as well as tangible. That is why a focus just on the tangible such as ‘website’, ‘net- work performance’ or ‘booking’ misses the point that customers see the world qualitatively, influenced by their subjective senses, based on ‘feel’ together with reason. Examples of this include their sense of trust, how satisfied they are, the ‘feel’ of the brand and so forth.\n\n2An objective-only definition will focus investments on technology, which is a considerable cost in terms of asset base if not connected to cus- tomer value. In this way, it may constrain opportunity-seeking behaviour, the ability to look for frequently small effective changes in the experience that mean something to the consumer. So a smooth tech platform that works, while being very important, would not on its own deliver a LUSH or Metro Bank experience. Nor would it lead to better people engagement. A technology-focused environment also risks creating an obsessive focus on risk management and hygiene factors with ‘operators’ confusing machine data with ‘that must be how the customer thinks.’\n\nHence, we lose the capability to focus on intangible benefits, the very thing consumers buy. Tangibility is only important as an enabler of intan- gible benefits.\n\n241\n\n242\n\nFootnotes\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nAmong other things, we will suggest that a metric, Return on CustomerSM, is sometimes more appropriate for gauging the degree to which a particular customer or group of customers is generating value for a business. Return on investment (ROI) measures the efficiency with which a business employs its capital to create value, and Return on Customer (ROC) is designed to measure the efficiency with which it\n\nPreface\n\nPreface\n\nemploys its customers to create value. The ROC metric is simple to understand, in principle, but it requires a sophisticated approach to comprehending and analyzing customer lifetime values and customer equity. With the computer analytics available today, however, this is no longer an insurmountable or even a particularly expensive or difficult task. And this kind of customer-based financial metric will ensure that a company properly uses customer value as the basis for executive decisions.1\n\nIn the years since the second edition of this book was released, we have contin- ued to teach seminars and workshops at universities and in for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and we have collaborated in depth with our own firm’s working consultants in various Peppers & Rogers Group offices around the world, from São Paulo to Dubai, and from London to Johannesburg. We have wrestled with the serious, real-world business problems of taking a customer-centric approach to business in different business categories, from telecom, financial services, and retail- ing, to packaged goods, pharmaceuticals, and business to business. Over the years, our experience in all these categories has reinforced our belief that the basic IDIC model (identify, differentiate, interact, customize) for thinking about customer rela- tionships is valid, practical, and useful, and that financial metrics based on customer value make the most sense. And we have continued documenting these issues, coauthoring a total of eight business trade books, in addition to this textbook.\n\nThe biggest change in this third edition, reflected in the title itself, is the addi- tional consideration of the importance of the creation of better and more personal- ized customer experiences. CX (customer experience) plays an increasingly greater strategic role, and we’ve devoted much discussion to it, as well as to the idea of CX journey mapping.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\ntomer is not.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nAnd this kind of bastardisation is nothing new. Take, for instance, another concept: customer relationship management (CRM). This started off talking about building a relationship with the customer until the term ‘relationship’ became defined as the ability to cross-sell and up- sell off a database.2\n\nROI was achieved for the vendor; relationship with the customer was not.\n\nThe Qualitative Difference\n\nSo let’s be clear, to use customer experience as a source of value differen- tiation means we must take account of its qualitative, phenomenological nature. We must define what customer experience as a ‘cognitive assess- ment’ means: where it differs from price, product and service quality and how it relates to customer value creation (e.g., the personal and memo- rable bit). In fact, in an environment where over-inflated data promises are spreading viruses such as taking such an approach to understanding customers has never mattered more.\n\nCompany, can you help us with our CEM programmes? Vendor: Measure and monitor everything; yes we can do that. It will of course mean building rocket science predictive models and putting in place extensive automated software systems. Here’s our ROI proof point against NPS using Advanced Regression. And of course we consider qualitative opinion; we take in a mass big data feed from social media and text verbatims applying a machine-based algorithm that spits out in realtime correlates to your key KPIs. Have a look at our nice shiny dash- board, architecture chart and proof of concept. That’ll be £1 million.\n\nSo, tell me what exactly is the customers experience after you put this system in place? Do you really believe that such an approach in toto picks up the real nature of experience?3\n\nAnalytics is the first fundamental step in any CX programme (Know where you are! Predict where you want to be), so we should really do a better job of tying analytics to experience to get the result we need.\n\nWhich is why, perhaps when it comes to customers and their experi- ence, by seeking to control it we are actually degrading it by missing out\n\n1 The Squonk\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nTo begin with, a company has to consider that customers, even if numerous, are finite in number. A company can make more products, but cannot manufacture more customers. And if customers are a scarce productive resource—imposing a constraint on a company’s growth—then it would make sense for executives to track how effi- ciently they use this scarce productive resource to create value. When an enterprise wants to track the efficiency with which it deploys capital to create more value, it uses some metric such as return on investment. Return on CustomerSM (ROCSM)50 is a metric directly analogous to ROI (and thus usually is pronounced are-oh-see) and specifically designed to track how well an enterprise is using customers to create value.51 (For an example of how a company can use up customer value, see the sec- tion “Using Up Customers” in Chapter 14.) ROC can provide a company with financial bifocals—a single lens through which it can see its earnings from customers clearly, whether these earnings are up close and immediate or in the more distant long term. To understand the ROC metric, start with a simple analogy. Imagine that last year you bought a stock for $100, and during the year you received a dividend pay- ment of $5, while the stock price climbed to $110 by the end of the year. Your total ROI for the year would have been 15 percent. You put up $100 initially, and the total new value created amounted to 15 percent of that initial investment. If, however, the stock price had fallen $10 during the year, from $100 down to $90, then your total ROI would have been a negative 5 percent, and even though you received a $5 dividend, you would have suffered a net loss overall.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nGoing back to our ferry experience, you would have thought that these insights would initiate a series of investments! But this is not necessarily so. For, once the feedback had been received, senior executives made the mistake of trying to answer the question, what is the ROI of cleaning the toilets and good signage to the port? They had rushed to ROI: a real risk with Efficiency brands!\n\nOf course because these are indirect effects difficult to quantify and part and parcel of a good place to do business in, it was not possible to answer in a root-cause way and the programmes were killed.\n\nIn other words, the rush to ROI missed the point that without an assured port experience the onboard ship experience was reduced in impact. Dissatisfaction with the port also acts as a lagged indicator to reduced value over the longer term and quite frankly a missed opportu- nity! Clean port experience means a better platform for nice restaurants and higher value of time well spent.\n\n3 Right Commercial Principles\n\nFor me it’s also interesting how no one ever asks the question, ‘What’s the ROI of unclean toilets and bad signage!’ After all there is ‘always an experience’. Or if you have a boring experience, ‘You’ll have boring driv- ers to that experience.’\n\nThe question is also ‘a tell’. What it really means is, we haven’t bought into customer experience as a strategic direction so we are really not inter- ested in executing it and we don’t care about building a relationship with our customers or employees! Hence, the programmes were considered a cost not an investment in ‘customer experience differentiation’.\n\nThe question, ‘What’s the ROI of customer experience?’ was not\n\nanswered by the reply: ‘What’s the cost of not doing it!’\n\nRisk 2: Experience as Everything\n\nThe next risk is how, if you don’t include the customer’s perception, you could end up calling anything customer experience.\n\nThis approach follows what I call the little e definition of customer experience. An approach best summed up, probably unwittingly, by Bernd Schmidt who wrote a full six years after Pine and Gilmore. Here customer experience is:\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\n1. Hence the old adage that claimed drives only weakly correlates to spend behaviour is true, but misses the point.\n\n2. Taken from Dave Snowden of Cognitive Edge. 3. I avoid the transformational experience which goes beyond customer experience. But point the reader to the book The Experience Economy, by Pine and Gilmour, to understand what this means.\n\n3\n\nRight Commercial Principles\n\n‘What is the return on customer experience?’ is like the question ‘What is the return on innovation?’ To which the answer is, it depends on what you do and how you do it! The important point is, nobody says, ‘Let’s see if there is an ROI on a prototypical word like innovation before we innovate!’ And the same should apply to customer experience: that is if you are serious about it.\n\nAfter all, customer experience isn’t a choice, there’s always an experi- ence whether you want to manage it or not and the ROI of customer experience is simply about the return derived from investing in the cus- tomer as a source of value just as we would a product or service.\n\nThe ROI of customer experience is also the wrong question! CX after all is an enabler; it gives the firm strategic options. Hence the question is like asking: ‘What is the ROI of having a phone!’ (Source: Professor Stan Maklan, see webinar on www.allaboutexperience.co.uk)\n\nWhich leads us to a far better question: not ‘What is the ROI on cus- tomer experience’ but ‘What is the ROI derived from the different ways of doing customer experience? And which way is best?’\n\nHowever, before we get into that, to do customer experience commer-\n\ncially we must appreciate a core principle.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nThe Core Principle\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nAn example of this is from the Leela Hotel in India. Here they started to cut corners to save money. When rooms were left empty during the day, the air conditioning was turned off and some of the beautiful displays of fruit were taken down to save time. But these small actions were intrinsic to value. Of course there is no ROI for each of these actions individually but by undertaking to remove them, the hotel was heading down the line of reducing the value of the hotel. Critically, this wasn’t about managing everything, the weak signals of failure (fruit displays and air condition- ing) were identified and quantifed by customers.\n\nAnd we shouldn’t forget the cultural feedback loop in this hotel example. These cost-cutting activities are the thin end of the wedge; if\n\n7 Customer Experience Is Complex\n\nsuccessful they can become bolder leading to a definite degradation of ‘experience’ and employee investment in the experience.\n\nManagement Implications\n\n1. Subjective data are not like building a car; they are not an engineering project.\n\n2. We respond with feeling, thought, a conditioned response. 3. Taking too much of a ‘calculative’ view of customers is that you will reduce your capability to understand the qualitative, descriptive, sen- sory, nonconscious, phenomenological experience.\n\n4. NPS is only a partial customer experience metric because it is designed for root-cause, complicated approaches.\n\n5. Subjectivity is more complex than complicated which means it is less amenable to root-cause analytics and more amenable to managing the flow.\n\n6. Be aware of dispositions: amplify the positive, reduce the negative. 7. Do experiments: trial and test is the only way to know if something will deliver ROI in a complex system.\n\n8. Any supposedly objective assessment that tries to identify drivers runs the risk of false reassurance for the organisation, encouraging compla- cency or misdirected intervention.\n\n9. Remember the employee and other stakeholders’ experience.\n\nNotes\n\n1. The irony here is that NPS does not measure dissatisfaction and a bipolar CSAT scale means consumers answer towards the neutral because a call centre has aspects of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, or answers tend towards the positive because you ask me about satisfaction! And I gift you an answer.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\n3. Customers create value in two ways. Today, they are generating profit this quar- ter (or not), and—also today—the experience they are having with a particular company’s product, its brand, its contact center, or any of the rest of what it is selling is also causing them to become more (or less) likely to do more business with the company in the future, to become more (or less) likely to recommend it to friends, to think kindly of it (or not) when they need something else in its category. It’s interesting that nearly every company is very, very good\n\nChapter 2: The Thinking behind Customer Relationships That Leads to Good Experiences\n\nat measuring and managing one way that customers create value: Companies know how much they spent making money from customers this quarter and what their revenue was from customers this quarter—since that’s the total of the cost and revenue on the quarterly books. But many companies are content not to know the second part of this equation: They don’t know, don’t measure, and don’t manage what is happening to underlying customer equity while the current numbers are falling into place. That means understanding a company’s Return on Customer (ROC) is as important as understanding the return on investment (ROI).1 We talk a lot more about ROC in Chapter 11.2 ROI answers the question: How much value does your company create for the\n\nmoney it uses?\n\nROC answers the question: How much value does your company create for the\n\ncustomers it has?\n\nIf customers are scarce, if they create all the revenue for a company, and if the value they do create is measurable and manageable in the short term and the long term, as of today, then it’s natural for companies to want to understand and remem- ber what customers need and to meet those needs better than a competitor that doesn’t know the same things about the customers. Customer information provides a very powerful competitive advantage. Companies want to use this information to provide a positive experience for customers and possibly to engage customers in a “relationship” that enables the company to provide better and better service.3\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nA simpler approach, and one that can provide better insights versus more data, is to organize your metrics under three headings: Financial Performance, which looks at all of your “cost‐per” data and ROI met- rics; Benchmarks, which are the key performance indicators that are meaningful to your team and/or management; and Insights, which allow you to fine‐tune your program and ensure that you are optimizing your ability to create meaningful business impact.\n\nHowever you go about it, metrics must relate directly to the goals you establish for your program or campaign. Cisco, for example, sets out its goals for GSX a full 12 months in advance, and everything is designed to track back to the goals and the strategy set forward when the team starts the planning cycle.\n\nMeASureMent trendS\n\nMore companies are measuring their event and experiential programs, and they are using a wider range of tracking metrics and approaches.\n\nroi expectations\n\nEvents and experiences provide a significant ROI. The survey asked specifi- cally: What ROI do you expect from events? Forty‐eight percent of brands realize an ROI of between 3:1 to 5:1, and 29 percent indicated their return is over 10:1. Twelve percent say their ROI is 20:1 or higher. (See Figure 7.3.)\n\n1 to 1 return\n\n9%\n\n2 to 1\n\n14%\n\n3 to 1\n\n23%\n\n4 to 1\n\n9%\n\n5 to 1\n\n16%\n\n10 to 1\n\n13%\n\n20 to 1\n\n4%\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 7.3 Average roi: experiential Marketing Source: EMI/Mosaic EventTrack 2015\n\nContinued\n\n152 Experiential Marketing\n\nContinued\n\nFigure 7.4 Performance Criteria Source: EMI/Mosaic EventTrack 2015\n\nPerformance Criteria\n\nThe top measure ment factors and criteria marketers are using to judge performance are total atten dance, Facebook and social media activity, and number of leads.

But even if we do pick up on emotion, how does it affect ROI?\n\nWell, in the immediacy of a situation, emotions certainly have direct root-cause effects. We can say, ‘We feel an emotion because of X,’ as long as we get close enough to the decision-making moment to ask! Hence, if ‘I’ felt aggrieved by the jewellry shop that broke my watch in the repair shop then blamed me, ‘I feel it,’ ‘I can say why,’ I never go back there again.\n\nBut this root-cause effect of emotion on ROI is not necessarily the case every time! Many times a flash of emotion does not directly relate to our spending less money or using you less often, as we saw in the travel adapter and hotel lobby examples.\n\nSo, the fact that ‘I’ felt ripped off by having to pay £3 for a printing company to put my memory stick into their machine is not going to directly lead me to leave or use them less often.\n\nIn this way emotions also indirectly affect value. Which leads us back to the concept of how an emergent sense of an experience informs our anticipation of an emotional reward: such as in the statement ‘I trust that brand.’ And this sense as we now know is built up from many small fleeting and dispositional emotions or affects we experience (these are the modulators). All things that are not so easy for traditional research to define because it assumes emotions act objectively and in a root-cause manner against a set scale.\n\n10 The Value of Emotions\n\nHence, we have to design in agile techniques of measurement and management. Otherwise, we will simply not be able to focus on emo- tion’s effects and be unaware of how customers use emotions to make decisions through understanding what an experience means.\n\nBut ultimately the real value of emotions comes from how we can use them to identify a new emotional value (a goal state), which means a capability to take the risk. After all, if you add something new, you won’t know if it works unless you try it!\n</source>\n",
