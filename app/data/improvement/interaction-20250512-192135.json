  "response": "\n\nOkay, let's delve into ROI and related frameworks within the context of customer experience (CX). Here's a breakdown, focusing on key concepts and considerations:\n\n**1. ROI & Return on Customer (ROC)**\n\nTraditional Return on Investment (ROI) measures how efficiently a business uses capital to generate value. A related concept, Return on Customer (ROC), measures how efficiently a business uses its customers to create value **(Source: doc_1)**. ROC requires a sophisticated understanding of customer lifetime value and customer equity, but modern analytics make this increasingly feasible.  The core idea is to use customer value as the basis for executive decisions **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**2. The Pitfalls of Focusing Solely on ROI in CX**\n\nIt's crucial to understand that directly calculating ROI for every CX initiative can be misleading.  Simply measuring everything and applying advanced analytics doesn't guarantee a better customer experience. In fact, it can degrade the experience by missing the qualitative aspects **(Source: doc_2)**.  The focus should be on understanding the *nature* of the customer experience, which is inherently qualitative and phenomenological.  Trying to control the experience through excessive data and automation can be counterproductive **(Source: doc_2)**.\n\n**3. Beyond Traditional ROI: A Broader Perspective**\n\n*   **Emotional Value:**  CX isn't just about tangible benefits; it's about intangible ones like trust and brand perception **(Source: doc_3)**.  Focusing solely on technology can neglect these crucial aspects.\n*   **The \"What's the ROI of...\" Trap:**  Asking \"What's the ROI of customer experience?\" is the wrong question. A better question is, \"What is the ROI derived from the different ways of doing customer experience? And which way is best?\" **(Source: doc_9)**.  It's about viewing CX as an enabler and strategic option, not just a cost **(Source: doc_9)**.\n*   **The Cost of *Not* Doing CX:**  Consider the cost of *not* investing in CX.  Neglecting customer experience can lead to a degraded experience, reduced employee engagement, and ultimately, a loss of competitive advantage **(Source: doc_10)**.\n\n**4. Related Frameworks & Metrics**\n\n*   **IDIC Model:**  This framework (Identify, Differentiate, Interact, Customize) provides a useful way to think about customer relationships **(Source: doc_1)**.\n*   **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** While NPS can be a useful metric, it shouldn't be the *sole* indicator of financial health. It's a partial view of the customer experience **(Source: doc_3)**.\n*   **CEM (Customer Experience Management):**  Be wary of vendors who promise complex, automated solutions for CEM without a clear understanding of the customer's experience **(Source: doc_2)**.\n*   **Measurement Trends:** Companies are increasingly measuring their event and experiential programs, using a wider range of tracking metrics **(Source: doc_5)**.  Expectations for ROI are high, with many brands realizing a 3:1 to 5:1 ROI, and some exceeding 10:1 **(Source: doc_5)**.\n*   **Three-Tiered Metrics:** A useful approach is to organize metrics into three categories: Financial Performance, Benchmarks, and Insights **(Source: doc_5)**.\n\n**5.  A Customer-Centric Framework for Retention and Development**\n\nA novel framework for retention and development recognizes that different tactics are more effective depending on the individual value of the customer **(Source: doc_8)**.\n\n**In summary:**  While ROI is important, a narrow focus on it can be detrimental to CX. A more holistic approach considers qualitative factors, views CX as a strategic enabler, and utilizes a range of metrics to understand and improve the customer journey.\n\n\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps explore a specific framework in more detail?",
  "context": "<source id=\"doc_1\" name=\"doc_1\">\nAmong other things, we will suggest that a metric, Return on CustomerSM, is sometimes more appropriate for gauging the degree to which a particular customer or group of customers is generating value for a business. Return on investment (ROI) measures the efficiency with which a business employs its capital to create value, and Return on Customer (ROC) is designed to measure the efficiency with which it\n\nPreface\n\nPreface\n\nemploys its customers to create value. The ROC metric is simple to understand, in principle, but it requires a sophisticated approach to comprehending and analyzing customer lifetime values and customer equity. With the computer analytics available today, however, this is no longer an insurmountable or even a particularly expensive or difficult task. And this kind of customer-based financial metric will ensure that a company properly uses customer value as the basis for executive decisions.1\n\nIn the years since the second edition of this book was released, we have contin- ued to teach seminars and workshops at universities and in for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and we have collaborated in depth with our own firm’s working consultants in various Peppers & Rogers Group offices around the world, from São Paulo to Dubai, and from London to Johannesburg. We have wrestled with the serious, real-world business problems of taking a customer-centric approach to business in different business categories, from telecom, financial services, and retail- ing, to packaged goods, pharmaceuticals, and business to business. Over the years, our experience in all these categories has reinforced our belief that the basic IDIC model (identify, differentiate, interact, customize) for thinking about customer rela- tionships is valid, practical, and useful, and that financial metrics based on customer value make the most sense. And we have continued documenting these issues, coauthoring a total of eight business trade books, in addition to this textbook.\n\nThe biggest change in this third edition, reflected in the title itself, is the addi- tional consideration of the importance of the creation of better and more personal- ized customer experiences. CX (customer experience) plays an increasingly greater strategic role, and we’ve devoted much discussion to it, as well as to the idea of CX journey mapping.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\ntomer is not.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nAnd this kind of bastardisation is nothing new. Take, for instance, another concept: customer relationship management (CRM). This started off talking about building a relationship with the customer until the term ‘relationship’ became defined as the ability to cross-sell and up- sell off a database.2\n\nROI was achieved for the vendor; relationship with the customer was not.\n\nThe Qualitative Difference\n\nSo let’s be clear, to use customer experience as a source of value differen- tiation means we must take account of its qualitative, phenomenological nature. We must define what customer experience as a ‘cognitive assess- ment’ means: where it differs from price, product and service quality and how it relates to customer value creation (e.g., the personal and memo- rable bit). In fact, in an environment where over-inflated data promises are spreading viruses such as taking such an approach to understanding customers has never mattered more.\n\nCompany, can you help us with our CEM programmes? Vendor: Measure and monitor everything; yes we can do that. It will of course mean building rocket science predictive models and putting in place extensive automated software systems. Here’s our ROI proof point against NPS using Advanced Regression. And of course we consider qualitative opinion; we take in a mass big data feed from social media and text verbatims applying a machine-based algorithm that spits out in realtime correlates to your key KPIs. Have a look at our nice shiny dash- board, architecture chart and proof of concept. That’ll be £1 million.\n\nSo, tell me what exactly is the customers experience after you put this system in place? Do you really believe that such an approach in toto picks up the real nature of experience?3\n\nAnalytics is the first fundamental step in any CX programme (Know where you are! Predict where you want to be), so we should really do a better job of tying analytics to experience to get the result we need.\n\nWhich is why, perhaps when it comes to customers and their experi- ence, by seeking to control it we are actually degrading it by missing out\n\n1 The Squonk\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\nYou are not going to find ROI – but if you tell me what you are look- ing for from customers and the brand then the money will take care of itself. There is no difference in measuring the ROI of training staff than CX. But this is not a leap of faith, you can draw a line between CX improvements and finances without breaking this down to $; if you go down one path and it is better for customers, and you are consistent with the brand then your will be better than the competition.\n\nNPS has overstated the relationship to the health of finances for so\n\nlong; but it’s not the case all the time.\n\nTo me CX is still the most interesting thing happening/not happening today, fascinating!\n\nFootnotes\n\n1A cognitive assessment of experience is about intangible benefits as well as tangible. That is why a focus just on the tangible such as ‘website’, ‘net- work performance’ or ‘booking’ misses the point that customers see the world qualitatively, influenced by their subjective senses, based on ‘feel’ together with reason. Examples of this include their sense of trust, how satisfied they are, the ‘feel’ of the brand and so forth.\n\n2An objective-only definition will focus investments on technology, which is a considerable cost in terms of asset base if not connected to cus- tomer value. In this way, it may constrain opportunity-seeking behaviour, the ability to look for frequently small effective changes in the experience that mean something to the consumer. So a smooth tech platform that works, while being very important, would not on its own deliver a LUSH or Metro Bank experience. Nor would it lead to better people engagement. A technology-focused environment also risks creating an obsessive focus on risk management and hygiene factors with ‘operators’ confusing machine data with ‘that must be how the customer thinks.’\n\nHence, we lose the capability to focus on intangible benefits, the very thing consumers buy. Tangibility is only important as an enabler of intan- gible benefits.\n\n241\n\n242\n\nFootnotes\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\n21. Drive through the theme/purpose of your business in the end-to-end journey: you need to be flexible but you must also be deliberate and consistent.\n\nHence, I challenge the process-orientated quantitative-only way map- ping is done today and put forward the view that complexity and goal state theory have already devised frameworks we can use that embed the flowing not static ‘experience the customer has,’ not forgetting that this means developing our internal empathy to understand what it is to be a customer and to enable collaboration and an innovation platform to execute cross-silo change.\n\nPart IV Emotions and the Customer Experience And now we get to emotion! Companies commit a fatal fl aw if they fail to account for emotion. After all, customer decision making cannot do without it. Consider for instance the scientifi c experiments of leading neurosci-entist Professor Antonio Damasio. Here patients who had their emotion centres damaged were found to be unable to make a decision. Because ‘emotions put the body in the loop of reason’ patients were unable to understand what was correct for them and unable to use the heuristics of emotion and perception to understand how to react in a complex situation. Which is why I fi nd the usual pushback – what’s the ROI of emo-tional response – unacceptable, because the answer is in every decision you make! Emotion is not a condition underlying just NPS, CSAT, CES, in the moment text verbatim or that slippery concept loyalty. All deci-sions, even functional ones, such as buying a lightbulb, engage emotions! Which means of course it is useless for us to say let’s create this emo-tion because there are 101 things that a feeling could relate to. So faced with this what should we do. Well I say focus not so much on emotion as on understanding emotional value. Defi ning where we can or could diff erentiate the experience the customer has based on these frequently hidden or underused emotional drives to use and buy.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nA simpler approach, and one that can provide better insights versus more data, is to organize your metrics under three headings: Financial Performance, which looks at all of your “cost‐per” data and ROI met- rics; Benchmarks, which are the key performance indicators that are meaningful to your team and/or management; and Insights, which allow you to fine‐tune your program and ensure that you are optimizing your ability to create meaningful business impact.\n\nHowever you go about it, metrics must relate directly to the goals you establish for your program or campaign. Cisco, for example, sets out its goals for GSX a full 12 months in advance, and everything is designed to track back to the goals and the strategy set forward when the team starts the planning cycle.\n\nMeASureMent trendS\n\nMore companies are measuring their event and experiential programs, and they are using a wider range of tracking metrics and approaches.\n\nroi expectations\n\nEvents and experiences provide a significant ROI. The survey asked specifi- cally: What ROI do you expect from events? Forty‐eight percent of brands realize an ROI of between 3:1 to 5:1, and 29 percent indicated their return is over 10:1. Twelve percent say their ROI is 20:1 or higher. (See Figure 7.3.)\n\n1 to 1 return\n\n9%\n\n2 to 1\n\n14%\n\n3 to 1\n\n23%\n\n4 to 1\n\n9%\n\n5 to 1\n\n16%\n\n10 to 1\n\n13%\n\n20 to 1\n\n4%\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 7.3 Average roi: experiential Marketing Source: EMI/Mosaic EventTrack 2015\n\nContinued\n\n152 Experiential Marketing\n\nContinued\n\nFigure 7.4 Performance Criteria Source: EMI/Mosaic EventTrack 2015\n\nPerformance Criteria\n\nThe top measure ment factors and criteria marketers are using to judge performance are total atten dance, Facebook and social media activity, and number of leads.

Here they started to cut corners to save money. When rooms were left empty during the day, the air conditioning was turned off and some of the beautiful displays of fruit were taken down to save time. But these small actions were intrinsic to value. Of course there is no ROI for each of these actions individually but by undertaking to remove them, the hotel was heading down the line of reducing the value of the hotel. Critically, this wasn’t about managing everything, the weak signals of failure (fruit displays and air condition- ing) were identified and quantifed by customers.\n\nAnd we shouldn’t forget the cultural feedback loop in this hotel example. These cost-cutting activities are the thin end of the wedge; if\n\n7 Customer Experience Is Complex\n\nsuccessful they can become bolder leading to a definite degradation of ‘experience’ and employee investment in the experience.\n\nManagement Implications\n\n1. Subjective data are not like building a car; they are not an engineering project.\n\n2. We respond with feeling, thought, a conditioned response. 3. Taking too much of a ‘calculative’ view of customers is that you will reduce your capability to understand the qualitative, descriptive, sen- sory, nonconscious, phenomenological experience.\n\n4. NPS is only a partial customer experience metric because it is designed for root-cause, complicated approaches.\n\n5. Subjectivity is more complex than complicated which means it is less amenable to root-cause analytics and more amenable to managing the flow.\n\n6. Be aware of dispositions: amplify the positive, reduce the negative. 7. Do experiments: trial and test is the only way to know if something will deliver ROI in a complex system.\n\n8. Any supposedly objective assessment that tries to identify drivers runs the risk of false reassurance for the organisation, encouraging compla- cency or misdirected intervention.\n\n9. Remember the employee and other stakeholders’ experience.\n\nNotes\n\n1. The irony here is that NPS does not measure dissatisfaction and a bipolar CSAT scale means consumers answer towards the neutral because a call centre has aspects of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, or answers tend towards the positive because you ask me about satisfaction! And I gift you an answer.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nThen we finally get to the bottom of the matter. The original office appointment to change my date of birth had in fact not been completed. The office had not sent my details by email to the relevant department who would then have no doubt reinput the details to complete my appli- cation. All this of course, I had not been told about and would take another week to resolve!\n\nIn such ways we can see how IT complex processing and multiple sys-\n\ntems and compliances have in fact destroyed the experience.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it was my great interaction with a person in a call centre that saved this experience: the humanic is more memorable and influential!\n\nTechnology needs human interpretation to move from efficiency\n\ntowards experience (Table 3.4).\n\nManagement Implications\n\n1. There is always a customer experience. 2. What’s the ROI of customer experience is like the question, ‘What’s the ROI of innovation’: the real question is: ‘What’s the ROI of the various ways of doing customer experience?’\n\n69\n\n70\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nTable 3.4 Quality questions\n\nDifferentiator Quality\n\nCompany offer\n\nExample\n\nCompany actions\n\nWhat we buy\n\nProduct\n\nPrice Product\n\n£1 Cup of coffee\n\nSell it\n\nHow we buy\n\nService\n\nfeatures Great service\n\n£1.50 Sit-down\n\nrestaurant\n\nCreate a buying environment\n\nHow we\n\nexperience\n\nHow we receive information\n\nExperience\n\nInformation\n\nAn\n\nexperience\n\nRelevant\n\ninformation\n\n£2 Peruvian Coffee Alcohol £2.50 A place to work More regular use, journey disruption personalised by me\n\nCreate a\n\npersonal and memorable environment\n\nCreate a sharing environment\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nA\tCustomer-Centric\tFramework\tfor\tRetention\tand\tDevelopment Data-driven\t technological\t advancements\t in\t the\t last\t half\t century\t have\t helped marketers\t fine-tune\t their\t up-selling\t and\t cross-selling\t tactics,\t such\t as\t using predictive\talgorithms\tto\tdetermine\twhich\tspecific\tproducts\tor\tservices\tshould\tbe cross-sold\tor\tupsold\tto\twhich\tindividual\tcustomers.\tHowever,\tthere\tare\tmany other\tways\tto\tbuild,\tsustain,\tand\trepair\tongoing\trelationships\tbeyond\tthese\tbasic tactics.\tHere\twe\tpresent\ta\tnovel\tframework\tfor\tretention\tand\tdevelopment\tthat recognizes\tthat\tdifferent\ttactics\tare\tmore\teffective\tdepending\ton\tthe\tindividual value\tof\tthe\tcustomer.\n\nThere\t are\t many\t retention\t and\t development\t (R&D)\t tactics\t out\t there\t that appear\tto\tbe,\tto\tthe\tuntrained\teye,\tsubstitutes\tfor\tone\tanother.\tThe\tblessing\tand curse\tof\tR&D\tis\tthat\tthey\tare\tso\tdeeply\tintertwined:\ta\tblessing\tbecause\texecuting these\t seemingly\t intertwined\t tactics\t affords\t certain\t organizational\t efficiencies, and\ta\tcurse\tbecause\tthe\tmuddied\tview\tof\tR&D\tmeans\tthat\torganizations\toften fail\tto\tunderstand\ttheir\tdistinctions\tand\ttherefore\tfail\tto\tgain\tmaximum\tstrategic benefit.\n\nAs\twe\tthink\tabout\tharmonizing\tour\tR&D\tprograms\twith\ta\tcustomer-centric\n\nstrategy,\twe\tcare\tabout\tunderstanding\tour\tpositioning\talong\ttwo\tdimensions:\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\n1. Hence the old adage that claimed drives only weakly correlates to spend behaviour is true, but misses the point.\n\n2. Taken from Dave Snowden of Cognitive Edge. 3. I avoid the transformational experience which goes beyond customer experience. But point the reader to the book The Experience Economy, by Pine and Gilmour, to understand what this means.\n\n3\n\nRight Commercial Principles\n\n‘What is the return on customer experience?’ is like the question ‘What is the return on innovation?’ To which the answer is, it depends on what you do and how you do it! The important point is, nobody says, ‘Let’s see if there is an ROI on a prototypical word like innovation before we innovate!’ And the same should apply to customer experience: that is if you are serious about it.\n\nAfter all, customer experience isn’t a choice, there’s always an experi- ence whether you want to manage it or not and the ROI of customer experience is simply about the return derived from investing in the cus- tomer as a source of value just as we would a product or service.\n\nThe ROI of customer experience is also the wrong question! CX after all is an enabler; it gives the firm strategic options. Hence the question is like asking: ‘What is the ROI of having a phone!’ (Source: Professor Stan Maklan, see webinar on www.allaboutexperience.co.uk)\n\nWhich leads us to a far better question: not ‘What is the ROI on cus- tomer experience’ but ‘What is the ROI derived from the different ways of doing customer experience? And which way is best?’\n\nHowever, before we get into that, to do customer experience commer-\n\ncially we must appreciate a core principle.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nThe Core Principle\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nGoing back to our ferry experience, you would have thought that these insights would initiate a series of investments! But this is not necessarily so. For, once the feedback had been received, senior executives made the mistake of trying to answer the question, what is the ROI of cleaning the toilets and good signage to the port? They had rushed to ROI: a real risk with Efficiency brands!\n\nOf course because these are indirect effects difficult to quantify and part and parcel of a good place to do business in, it was not possible to answer in a root-cause way and the programmes were killed.\n\nIn other words, the rush to ROI missed the point that without an assured port experience the onboard ship experience was reduced in impact. Dissatisfaction with the port also acts as a lagged indicator to reduced value over the longer term and quite frankly a missed opportu- nity! Clean port experience means a better platform for nice restaurants and higher value of time well spent.\n\n3 Right Commercial Principles\n\nFor me it’s also interesting how no one ever asks the question, ‘What’s the ROI of unclean toilets and bad signage!’ After all there is ‘always an experience’. Or if you have a boring experience, ‘You’ll have boring driv- ers to that experience.’\n\nThe question is also ‘a tell’. What it really means is, we haven’t bought into customer experience as a strategic direction so we are really not inter- ested in executing it and we don’t care about building a relationship with our customers or employees! Hence, the programmes were considered a cost not an investment in ‘customer experience differentiation’.\n\nThe question, ‘What’s the ROI of customer experience?’ was not\n\nanswered by the reply: ‘What’s the cost of not doing it!’\n\nRisk 2: Experience as Everything\n\nThe next risk is how, if you don’t include the customer’s perception, you could end up calling anything customer experience.\n\nThis approach follows what I call the little e definition of customer experience. An approach best summed up, probably unwittingly, by Bernd Schmidt who wrote a full six years after Pine and Gilmore. Here customer experience is:\n</source>\n",
