  "response": "\n\nOkay, let's break down basic CX terms, formats, and architectures.\n\n**Core CX Terms:**\n\n*   **Customer Experience (CX):** This encompasses the *customer’s perception of all interactions* with a firm, spanning pre- and post-service encounters, emotional and functional dimensions, and the customer’s social context. It's broader than customer service, which focuses on single interactions **(Source: doc_1)**.\n*   **Customer Journey:** A visual representation of the customer's experience across all touchpoints and channels. Mapping this journey helps identify pain points and opportunities for improvement **(Source: doc_4)**.\n*   **Touchpoints:** Any interaction a customer has with a company (e.g., website, phone call, in-store visit).\n*   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** A measure of how happy customers are with a specific interaction or product.\n*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** A metric that gauges customer loyalty and willingness to recommend a company. While used to monitor CX, NPS has limitations as it doesn't provide detailed forensic data **(Source: doc_6)**.\n*   **User Experience (UX):** Focuses on the usability and enjoyment of a *product* (website, app, physical product). UX is a component of CX, but CX is broader **(Source: doc_8)**.\n\n**CX Formats & Architectures:**\n\nThe practitioner literature often lacks a holistic perspective on CX, but here are some common approaches:\n\n1.  **Customer-Journey Mapping:** A common tool for visualizing and analyzing the customer experience. Financial services firms often use a continuum model to map touchpoints and stages **(Source: doc_4)**.\n2.  **Process-Based Tools:** Some organizations use process management tools, but the dominant activities are channel and back-office integration **(Source: doc_2)**.\n3.  **Five Dimensions of CX Management:** A framework identifying key areas for CX strategy and management:\n    *   CX definitions, scope, and objectives\n    *   Governance of CX\n    *   Management of CX (processes and implementation)\n    *   CX policy development\n    *   CX challenges **(Source: doc_3)**\n\n**Architectural Considerations (Based on the provided snippets):**\n\n*   **Multi-Channel Integration:**  A key challenge and goal is integrating all channels to provide a consistent experience **(Source: doc_4)**.\n*   **Inside-Out vs. Outside-In:**  A crucial shift is moving from an \"inside-out\" perspective (focused on what the company sells) to an \"outside-in\" perspective (focused on the customer's motivations) **(Source: doc_7)**.\n*   **Holistic View:**  CX requires a holistic view that embraces all facets of the customer experience, including its strategic role **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:** The provided snippets don't offer extensive detail on specific CX architectures. They primarily focus on management practices and the evolution of CX thinking.",

Both conceptual and empirical studies focus on three main themes: best practice (e.g., Springer et al. 2011), how CX management relates to certain outcomes, and a combination of the two to introduce a tool or framework, such as customer-journey mapping (Rawson et al. 2013). The reports that define customer experience, just like academic research, favor the notion of the customer’s perception of all interactions with the firm (e.g., Klaus 2013). The reports can be roughly divided into those written from either the customer’s or the firm’s viewpoint. The cus- tomer’s view reports elaborate on how this should shape CX management practices. The consultants often focus on a particular approach to translate this knowledge into action (e.g., Girouard et al. 2012). The firm’s view reports often focus on one particular area of possible improvement, such as partner alignment (Hagen 2013). In contrast to academic literature that explores definitions, antecedents, and consequences of CX, the prac- titioner focus is on tools and best practice that improve performance in one specific (manageable) area/context of CX management. The current practitioner literature therefore lacks a holistic perspective that embraces all facets of CX practice, including its strategic role.\n\nThe emerging CX concept, aimed at guiding CX strategy and CX manage- ment, is broader than the limited functional service encounter suggested by current measures. It includes pre- and post-service encounter/pur- chase/consumption experiences, addresses emotional as well as functional dimensions of quality, and includes the customer’s social context. It includes an assessment of value-in-use, is formed over multiple channels, and varies with context (Lemke et al. 2011).\n\nHowever, these holistic concepts of CX are often too broad in nature and are therefore not suitable to support organizations in successfully managing customer experiences and developing CX strategies. Klaus and Maklan’s (2012) measurement of customer experience quality (EXQ) cap- tures not only all facets of the construct of the customer experience, but measures the impact of the distinctive drivers of the customer experience on each of the components of the customer experience. They conclude, “Managing the customer experience is, therefore, different from manag- ing customer service which focuses upon single service episodes under the\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nThough sometimes inconsistent, managerial definitions and the scope of CX reflect what we find in academic literature. The dominant themes emerging from our interviews are that CX management enacts the firm’s brand values and provides emotional and functional benefits to customers through moti- vated employees and consistently across various customer touch-points and channels. The notion of a sequence of encounters with customers designed by the firm and leading to an emotional attachment to the brand is also a central theme in research (Hume et al. 2006); the centrality of people in CX is equally well documented (e.g., Heskett et al. 1997).\n\nAnalyzing what managers do in practice, the typology suggests CX management is a development of both quality and relationship market- ing practices. Managers articulate clearly the origins of their CX programs from existent activities in one or both areas. Typically, a firm identifies poor quality and/or inconsistent service delivery as an inhibitor to attracting and retaining their most profitable customers, and envisions a CX program to address the issues. Managers, without exception, take a pragmatic perspective, and position CX as an extension of well-understood, existing activities.\n\nWhile the “what” of CX management is aligned broadly with scientific research findings, the “how” diverges. Researchers’ advice for implement- ing CX involves deploying process management tools around a sequence of customer encounters and extending those tools to design elements that provoke emotional responses. Accepting that traditional quality\n\n55\n\n56\n\nMeasuring Customer Experience\n\nmanagement focuses too narrowly on the repeatability of service actions within a tight variance of output, CX scholars create tools that focus on functional and emotional outcomes including the Servicescape (Bitner 1992), multi-level service design (Patricio et al. 2011), and learning from drama (Goodwin et al. 1996). We found evidence for the use of process- based tools in only one interview. The dominant management activities associated with CX were channel (touch-point) integration and back–front office integration. An implicit assumption held by the managers was that delivering their brand values consistently will improve CX. This approach confuses consistency with effectiveness. The relationship between the consistent delivery of brand values and the creation of customer value, and/or business outcomes, is, if existent, only indirect.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\nThere was no coherent view on the most appropriate measures. Eight firms were unable to quantify the relationship between their CX programs and financial outcomes. Respondents often referred to a causal chain between better customer experiences, improved satisfaction, and then increased loyalty. Others tried to estimate the direct impact of their investments in CX on their revenue or profits. No clear evidence for the measurability of this direct link was provided, which reflects the first challenge of CX strategy, or as one respondent suggested:\n\nIf I can’t clearly define it, how can I know if it’s going to improve (our performance)? (Respondent 2)\n\n41\n\n42\n\nMeasuring Customer Experience\n\nCX as a long-term investment\n\nEven if organizations overcome this challenge, they face an uphill battle to create the awareness that investments in CX do not provide immediate and recognizable financial outcomes. The consensus is that while a reason- ably long-term view of the strategy is necessary, there are pressures to demonstrate immediate return:\n\n[…] building it (the CX program) conflicts with short-term goals, aims, and priorities of shareholders and so on. (Respondent 13)\n\nThe corresponding five CX management practices and their descriptions are summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nAfter carefully analysing all case studies according to the five dimensions of CX practice, we developed an even more detailed view of what the 47 “key ingredients” of each of the five dimensions are, and created Table 3.2 to demonstrate our coding approach.\n\nHaving established the five main dimensions of CX strategy and manage- ment practice, we are now able to build a typology of how the companies managed their CX program and explore the crucial relationship between these practices and profitability.\n\ntable 3.1 Customer experience management dimensions\n\nDimensions\n\nDefinition\n\nCX definitions, scope, and objectives\n\nOrganizations’ definitions of CX, its scope, and objectives\n\nGovernance of CX\n\nComments related to a need for systematic management of CX under leadership of a responsible manager\n\nManagement of CX\n\nReports a model of ideal experiences and a set of business processes against that ideal (i.e., existence of a CX business plan/model and business processes)\n\nCX policy development\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\npractices. The key components of Vanguards in financial services and their management practices support our typology, but there are some striking similarities in terms of what they consider key components of the CX prac- tices. All Vanguards describe their CX strategy as based on a continuum (see Klaus et al. 2013). Vanguard firms use this continuum notion to model CX touch-points and stages maps. These stages are mostly generic, but firms develop detailed CX maps at a more granular level for each main product line. For instance, an insurance company produced a different model for each of its three main savings products (i.e., life cover; tax-exempt savings plans, and bonds). Financial services firms differentiate between the con- cepts of “product” and “process,” and create process and experience designs according to their customer requirements. CX management is, therefore, an extension of, and embedded in, the end-to-end process design. Based upon this CX practice, firms identify and select improvement opportunities, with the emphasis on locating under-performing moments of truths, often referred to as fail, break, or pain points. A break point is a critical encounter that consistently attracts negative feedback from customers. It is associated with an increase in customer pain and has an adverse effect on key customer outcomes. Thus, firms allocate resources to improving failed moments of truth. In summary, the focus is on avoiding bad experiences. In the follow- ing section I will introduce an example of how all these components are used to move towards the most profitable CX strategies. It’s a story that demonstrates how to become a Vanguard.\n\nHow to overcome the challenges – an illustration\n\nIn today’s economy, the multi-channel business model increasingly becomes the prevalent one. Many firms today are struggling to come to a consensus on how to move towards a successful (multi-channel) CX strategy. Our stud- ies detail the tensions (between departments, functions, different stakehold- ers) that firms have to first overcome in order to succeed with a CX strategy that is accepted company-wide. Once this has been achieved, firms face the task of managing the CX transformation internally. We encourage firms to overcome their “silo” challenges and adopt a holistic view of how all channels can contribute to the customer experience and organizational success.\n\n107\n\n108\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\ninsights into the history and evolution of CX. It defines CX from a manage- rial viewpoint and uses a global study to clearly define CX and its manage- ment practices from a firm’s viewpoint. Next, it connects these practices to profitability, indicating which strategies are the most profitable ones. Based upon these insights, Measuring Customer Experience gives examples of how to move step-by-step towards the most profitable CX strategies. It delivers a CX measurement, one of the most crucial challenges for all firms – EXQ. Combining all these insights, Measuring Customer Experience demonstrates different options for embarking on the journey towards becoming a Vanguard, for example, by using EXQ as a “Trojan horse.”\n\nI can share with you that the first question posed by managers after being exposed to our research findings is “How can I become a Vanguard?” This is a very good question indeed, and if I had to summarize the essence of Measuring Customer Experience I would advise you to take the following steps in order to design profitable CX strategies:\n\n1. Establish your “status quo” and draw a strategic roadmap for becoming\n\na Vanguard. Our typology of CX strategies and management practices allows you to establish current and desired states. This allows firms to draw a roadmap of how to implement and execute their new strategy on all levels of CX management and, in the process, develop corresponding practices and capabilities.\n\n2. Focus CX strategy on a continuum, and not on single encounters.\n\nEvery direct and indirect interaction with the firm affects the cus- tomer’s perception of quality. Therefore, it is important to improve all interactions as parts of a continuum (Klaus et al. 2013).\n\n3. Integrate all organizational units.\n\nAll organizational units contributing to the customer experience need to be integrated into the CX program. Often, different teams or units manage customers at different stages.\n\n4. Measure the effects of actions on CX in a dynamic fashion.\n\nAnchor your CX strategy around measuring EXQ constantly in a lon- gitudinal way. This will allow you to monitor the effectiveness of your\n\n115\n\n116\n\nMeasuring Customer Experience\n\nCX practices proactively and take advantage of the explanatory and predictive power of EXQ.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nEschewing calls in the literature for measuring the CX construct (Verhoef et al. 2009; Klaus & Maklan 2012), managers use customer satisfaction and NPS to monitor customers’ overall assessments of encounters with the firm. While consistent with the broader definition of CX, neither NPS nor satisfaction generates the forensic data to identify those areas of experi- ence that influence experience the most. Equally, such measures limit the universe to existing customers and fail to identify the experiences of lapsed and competitive users, who are normally the majority of the market. Managers often recognize the limitations of their CX measurement policies but either do not know of a better measure or feel that the simplicity of a single number (satisfaction or NPS) outweighs the benefits of accuracy.\n\nOur findings also challenge a widely held view in the literature that CX practices are context specific. We find common practices, and moreover, common challenges, across all contexts. This seems to hold across B2B and B2C. Similar to Lemke et al. (2011), we found only limited differ- ences between the practices of B2B and B2C organizations. Whilst the business customer is often described as a multi-agent decision-making unit (Webster Jr. & Wind 1972; Johnston & Bonoma 1981; McDonald et al. 1997), respondents talked about them in the singular. They perceive a client experience as the sum of all experiences across all agents of that decision unit. Hence, managerial practices correspond with those found in B2C companies across all three types.\n\nThe 3 Types of CX Management Practice\n\ndespite the lack of definition and being driven by belief rather than evidence, CX is a, if not the, strategic objective for organizations\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nAnd of course, delivering efficiency only and a thin UX design you call CX, and encouraging bad behaviour opposed to the experience the customer has will only ever be a short-term approach because CX will not be in the DNA of the company and employees will become demoralised, that is, if they care. For instance, here is an example of ‘inside–outness’: the comparison being between the bad CX view of an IT supplier and the good CX view of its operator clients (Table 12.1).\n\nIn total, there was only a 23% agreement on the touchpoints of a customer experience between the technologist’s view and the outside–in operators (source: three operators). Of course the main agreement was around the quantitative elements of finance and engineering, whereas the store, the main focus for decision making was hardly even considered by technologists as important to the customer. And no one considered interaction!\n\nIt’s clearly a hard road to move your focus from yourself and what sells a box to the customer and what drives or could drive their motivation.\n\n213\n\n214\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nTable 12.1 Myopic inside–out view\n\nJourney step\n\n% Agreement of journey attributes, between inside–out and outside–in\n\nAwareness Marketing Store Activation Recharging Product Website Overall feel Call centre Network (use) Billing and payment Tariffs and pricing\n\n11 40 Less than 1 18 0 17 25 0 Less than 1 66 25 77\n\nService Delivery Isn’t CX\n\nWhich brings me to another point: service delivery is not the same as customer experience! If it was the same, we would not have a new para- digm and our management would be called service management. Let me explain by example.\n\nIn CX our starting point is to think of the customer as the main source of value to the business; our aim is to understand this source of value through greater appreciation of how customers think, feel and behave towards us (in other words their customer experience). Using this understanding, we then improve ‘their’ experience in such a way that they spend more with us over a potentially longer period of time and feel better about it!\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nUX is part of CX, so each product needs to be user friendly. In UX, a user involves a product that should be used. The activities and experience surrounding this are basically limited to that product, even if that “product” is an app, a Web site, a service, or a physical object.\n\nHere is an example of UX, driven by CX:\n\nClear Description\n\nDescription has all of the features I want and great packaging.\n\nClear Value Statements Expressing a clear value proposition in relation to price I must pay for it.\n\nSolutions Approach\n\nAll of the pieces I need are in once place and easy to understand.\n\nSimple and Fast\n\nProviding a speedy and simple installation process.\n\nClear Communication Good help desk online and on the phone.\n\nThey even have staff to explain it!\n\nCONSIDER\n\nBUY\n\nINSTALL\n\nUSE/SUPPORT\n\nClear Description\n\nBig Screen\n\nClear Value Statement\n\nSolution Approach\n\nSimple & Fast\n\nThey Deliver\n\nEasy to Get Help\n\nKnown Company\n\nEasy to Buy\n\nTested before Install\n\nCustomized User Manual\n\nRelevant\n\nKnown Company\n\nTested before Install\n\nDelivery\n\nWhat I was looking for generally.\n\nLocated where I can examine it.\n\nI know and trust this company.\n\nThey will be a good source.\n\nEnsuring a functioning installation via thorough testing.\n\nThey deliver—so do others, but they are doing it on Sunday!\n\nMany options.\n\nSource: East Bay Group, 2016.\n\nThe customer experience as a whole is, of course, infl uenced by the quality of the UX at each point, but CX is especially interested in the entire customer journey from start to fi nish, with multiple products or channels used in that journey, including video, wav fi les, and content from interaction channels and other sources.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Map?\n\nThe best maps provide:\n\n■ A visualization of customer interactions through many fi lters (emotional/\n\nrational) organized by the customer’s perspective.\n\n■ A living document that evolves with the constantly changing organization\n\nit supports.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nwas provided with conceptual descriptions of the resulting five dimen- sions and asked to assess them as “very applicable,” “somewhat applicable,” or “not applicable.” An attribute needed a minimum assessment of “some- what applicable” to be retained. This procedure resulted in the retention of all 47 attributes in five dimensions. Five CX managers confirmed the conceptual model and reviewed both the readability and applicability of the five dimensions and corresponding attributes. The next chapter will present the five dimensions of CX management.\n\n29\n\nchapter 3\n\nThe 5 Dimensions of CX Management\n\nThrough the process described in Chapter 2, we identified the five dimen- sions of CX practice as:\n\n1. the definition of CX, its scope and objectives; 2. the management of CX within the firm – processes and implementation; 3. the governance of CX – metrics and leadership; 4. how CX policy is developed over time; and 5. the CX challenges faced by the firm as it looks towards the future. In this chapter, rather than simply describing the findings of our study, I enrich the presentation with quotes from the managers on how they define their practices, achievements, and challenges.\n\nCX definitions, scope, and objectives\n\nManagers report a wide range of reasons and objectives for initiating their CX programs. Only three of the interviewees, however, articulated a precise definition for their CX strategy/program. Only two managers could identify measurable targets for their CX management. Most of the informants\n\nm anagers report a wide range of reasons and objectives for initiating their CX programs\n\n30\n\nThe 5 Dimensions of CX Management\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nThe primary hurdles firms must overcome to develop a coherent CX management strategy are: (1) defining what is or what constitutes CX; (2) demonstrating its link to performance; (3) establishing a clear gov- ernance structure for CX policy and continual improvement; (4) creating a CX program; (5) training the staff involved in it. We find substantial evidence that the primary challenges to developing and implementing a CX strategy are based on the lack of a clear defi- nition of what constitutes CX and how to measure it. Despite the lack of definition and being driven by belief rather than evidence, CX is a, if not the, strategic objective for organizations.\n\nLet’s reflect for a moment … We now know lots about the history of CX, its origins, and how to avoid possible traps. Based upon this we explored how CX is managed in the real world, and discovered that there are three distinctive practices, those of Preservers, Transformers, and Vanguards, which are common across industries, segments, location, and company size. So, how can we use this knowledge to our benefit? Well, first, we have to establish whether one of the three practices is more profitable, and the next chapter is dedicated to answering this question.\n\n57\n\nchapter 5\n\nLinking CX Practices to Profitability\n\nResearchers, managers, and consultants alike champion the notion that optimizing the customer experience is the key strategy for generating enhanced sales revenues, market share, and profitability. However, until now, there was no typology to assist us in the task of putting this notion to the test and establishing which strategies are the most profitable ones.\n\nIn order to achieve this, we conducted a global study, conducting interviews with 311 CX managers around the globe. The interviewers asked managers to rank their agreement on a 7-point scale for all 48 CX manage ment prac- tice items in order to determine which cluster (Preservers, Transformers, Vanguards) their practices belonged to. In addition, managers answered various business, personal, demographic, firm performance, and behavioral questions. We analyzed the data using the SPSS and Latent Gold software packages to ensure the validity and reliability of our findings.\n\nWho shared their insights – information about our experts\n</source>\n",
