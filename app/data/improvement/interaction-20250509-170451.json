  "response": "\n\nOkay, here's a quick rundown of basic Customer Experience (CX) concepts, especially regarding Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n**What is CX?**\n\nCX is about understanding and managing the *entire* customer journey – all interactions a customer has with your brand, from initial awareness to post-purchase support. It's not just about service; it encompasses product design, marketing, sales, and everything in between. It's about creating experiences that are personal, memorable, and meaningfully different **(Source: doc_6)**. A key aspect is recognizing the qualitative nature of experience – it's about how customers *feel* and perceive your brand, not just tangible aspects like website performance **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**ROI of CX: It's Not About a Simple Calculation**\n\nThe traditional ROI calculation (investment vs. financial gain) doesn't always apply directly to CX.  Instead of seeking a direct dollar-for-dollar return, focus on the broader impact.  The most important thing is to deliver CX consistently and through a shared vision or purpose **(Source: doc_6)**.\n\n**Correlations, Not Direct Causation**\n\nData shows strong correlations between CX and key financial metrics, but it's not a simple cause-and-effect relationship:\n\n*   **Advocacy:** A very high correlation (Pearson coefficient of 0.82) exists between positive CX and customers' likelihood to recommend your brand **(Source: doc_2)**.\n*   **Rebuying:**  There's also a strong correlation (0.69) between CX and customers' likelihood to purchase more from you **(Source: doc_2)**.\n*   **Industry Satisfaction:** These correlations hold true across various industries and countries **(Source: doc_2)**.\n\n**Beyond NPS – A Holistic View**\n\nWhile Net Promoter Score (NPS) is often used, it can overstate the relationship to financial health **(Source: doc_1)**.  A focus solely on technology or hygiene factors (like a smooth website) won't deliver a truly exceptional experience **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**The Bigger Picture: Survival and Differentiation**\n\nUltimately, the ROI of CX is about survival and differentiation.  If competitors are delivering superior experiences, you *must* keep pace **(Source: doc_6)**.  It's a business strategy, not just a department **(Source: doc_6)**.  Focusing solely on cost reduction or short-term sales growth at the expense of CX can lead to long-term losses **(Source: doc_9)**.\n\n**Return on Customer (ROC)**\n\nA more appropriate metric is Return on Customer (ROC), which measures how efficiently a business employs its customers to create value **(Source: doc_3)**. This requires a sophisticated approach to understanding customer lifetime values and customer equity.\n\n**Important Note:** Don't confuse CX with simply improving processes or cutting costs.  Doing so can degrade the customer experience **(Source: doc_4)**.\n\n\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any of these points?",
  "context": "<source id=\"doc_1\" name=\"doc_1\">\nYou are not going to find ROI – but if you tell me what you are look- ing for from customers and the brand then the money will take care of itself. There is no difference in measuring the ROI of training staff than CX. But this is not a leap of faith, you can draw a line between CX improvements and finances without breaking this down to $; if you go down one path and it is better for customers, and you are consistent with the brand then your will be better than the competition.\n\nNPS has overstated the relationship to the health of finances for so\n\nlong; but it’s not the case all the time.\n\nTo me CX is still the most interesting thing happening/not happening today, fascinating!\n\nFootnotes\n\n1A cognitive assessment of experience is about intangible benefits as well as tangible. That is why a focus just on the tangible such as ‘website’, ‘net- work performance’ or ‘booking’ misses the point that customers see the world qualitatively, influenced by their subjective senses, based on ‘feel’ together with reason. Examples of this include their sense of trust, how satisfied they are, the ‘feel’ of the brand and so forth.\n\n2An objective-only definition will focus investments on technology, which is a considerable cost in terms of asset base if not connected to cus- tomer value. In this way, it may constrain opportunity-seeking behaviour, the ability to look for frequently small effective changes in the experience that mean something to the consumer. So a smooth tech platform that works, while being very important, would not on its own deliver a LUSH or Metro Bank experience. Nor would it lead to better people engagement. A technology-focused environment also risks creating an obsessive focus on risk management and hygiene factors with ‘operators’ confusing machine data with ‘that must be how the customer thinks.’\n\nHence, we lose the capability to focus on intangible benefits, the very thing consumers buy. Tangibility is only important as an enabler of intan- gible benefits.\n\n241\n\n242\n\nFootnotes\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nROI: CX Correlates with Advocacy\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n100%\n\ne t a R\n\n) y r t n u o c\n\n90%\n\n+ With\n\ncorrelation Pearson coefficient of 0.82, there is a very high correlation between customer experience (CX) and likelihood to recommend.\n\na\n\nd n e m m o c e R\n\no t\n\nd o o h i l e k i L\n\nh c a e\n\nn i h t i w\n\ny r t s u d n i\n\nh c a e\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\nr o f (\n\n50%\n\nABOUT\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\nBase: 28,400 consumers across 26 countries Source: Qualtrics XM Institute Q3 2023 Global Consumer Study\n\nxminstitute.com\n\nIndustry satisfaction rates within each country correlate with likelihood to recommend rates 28 countries across 20 industries, 480 data points\n\nPearson correlation coefficient = .82\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\nSatisfaction Rate (for each industry within each country)\n\nCopyright © 2024 Qualtrics®.

Return on investment (ROI) measures the efficiency with which a business employs its capital to create value, and Return on Customer (ROC) is designed to measure the efficiency with which it\n\nPreface\n\nPreface\n\nemploys its customers to create value. The ROC metric is simple to understand, in principle, but it requires a sophisticated approach to comprehending and analyzing customer lifetime values and customer equity. With the computer analytics available today, however, this is no longer an insurmountable or even a particularly expensive or difficult task. And this kind of customer-based financial metric will ensure that a company properly uses customer value as the basis for executive decisions.1\n\nIn the years since the second edition of this book was released, we have contin- ued to teach seminars and workshops at universities and in for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and we have collaborated in depth with our own firm’s working consultants in various Peppers & Rogers Group offices around the world, from São Paulo to Dubai, and from London to Johannesburg. We have wrestled with the serious, real-world business problems of taking a customer-centric approach to business in different business categories, from telecom, financial services, and retail- ing, to packaged goods, pharmaceuticals, and business to business. Over the years, our experience in all these categories has reinforced our belief that the basic IDIC model (identify, differentiate, interact, customize) for thinking about customer rela- tionships is valid, practical, and useful, and that financial metrics based on customer value make the most sense. And we have continued documenting these issues, coauthoring a total of eight business trade books, in addition to this textbook.\n\nThe biggest change in this third edition, reflected in the title itself, is the addi- tional consideration of the importance of the creation of better and more personal- ized customer experiences. CX (customer experience) plays an increasingly greater strategic role, and we’ve devoted much discussion to it, as well as to the idea of CX journey mapping.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nthe ‘experience the customer has’, then don’t do it. Opex reduction, pro- cess efficiency, cost cutting and sales growth, never mind the ‘experience,’ are all fine and well-established principles. I have no problem with them.\n\nJust don’t pretend you’re doing ‘customer experience’. At the end of the day CX cannot claim all and every benefit and nor should it. Sometimes, frequently even, there is a place for other ways of doing business, but without a clear idea of what experience is and its limitations we will never know what it means and where to apply it. And that way will only lead to its death.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Customer experience has become a general term for: (1) service design, (2) seeing things through the customer’s eyes and (3) serving up any old thing as ‘selling experience’. Apart from the last item, this is not a bad thing. But it does mean it holds little difference in meaning from say service and cus- tomer research! Hence, service design should really be experience design. In addition, the complexity of digitalisation and multichannel integra- tion has meant that the words ‘customer experience’ are just useful terms with which to talk about user experience. This is all fine, but an over- brand is not enough, even if it does give a sense of mystique (not quite definable, slippery, can mean what you want, magical!). We need to con- sider the experience economy definition and how we can create an experi- ence not manage one.\n\n2. I am aware that relationship marketing is the origin here and that there is a clear ROI of CRM based on software. However, I stand by my com- ment: if you use a qualitative term like relationship then you need to demonstrate a qualitative benefit!\n\n3. If you take a technology enabler to be ‘the customer experience’, you risk assuming that when the machine KPIs work well then the customer must be happy! This is not necessarily the case if the customer thinks of the ‘enablement’ as hygienic. And certainly not the case because no customer buys the tech enablement; they buy the benefit that’s derived. ence definition?\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\ntomer is not.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nAnd this kind of bastardisation is nothing new. Take, for instance, another concept: customer relationship management (CRM). This started off talking about building a relationship with the customer until the term ‘relationship’ became defined as the ability to cross-sell and up- sell off a database.2\n\nROI was achieved for the vendor; relationship with the customer was not.\n\nThe Qualitative Difference\n\nSo let’s be clear, to use customer experience as a source of value differen- tiation means we must take account of its qualitative, phenomenological nature. We must define what customer experience as a ‘cognitive assess- ment’ means: where it differs from price, product and service quality and how it relates to customer value creation (e.g., the personal and memo- rable bit). In fact, in an environment where over-inflated data promises are spreading viruses such as taking such an approach to understanding customers has never mattered more.\n\nCompany, can you help us with our CEM programmes? Vendor: Measure and monitor everything; yes we can do that. It will of course mean building rocket science predictive models and putting in place extensive automated software systems. Here’s our ROI proof point against NPS using Advanced Regression. And of course we consider qualitative opinion; we take in a mass big data feed from social media and text verbatims applying a machine-based algorithm that spits out in realtime correlates to your key KPIs. Have a look at our nice shiny dash- board, architecture chart and proof of concept. That’ll be £1 million.\n\nSo, tell me what exactly is the customers experience after you put this system in place? Do you really believe that such an approach in toto picks up the real nature of experience?3\n\nAnalytics is the first fundamental step in any CX programme (Know where you are! Predict where you want to be), so we should really do a better job of tying analytics to experience to get the result we need.\n\nWhich is why, perhaps when it comes to customers and their experi- ence, by seeking to control it we are actually degrading it by missing out\n\n1 The Squonk\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nGet to the Question\n\nHowever, I still believe that before we get to the answer we need to first consider the question.\n\n235\n\n236\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nToo much for me has already been written about grand schemes to de- silo the organisation, customer obsession, put the customer at the heart of things and so forth. But none of this can be done if we still seek to KPI in a manner that creates dysfunction, distance, an inability to change and a failure to understand the customer.\n\nPerhaps you will now understand why in this book I have put so much emphasis on measurement and the use of complexity tools and other mul- timethod approaches and the need to set parameters rather than targets, as well as the need to get down to brass tacks and seek to re- understand what it is to say: ‘We want to do CEM.’\n\nHence, I believe that raising the efficiency–experience debate is crucial. Which of course asks the question of leaders: which way do you want\n\nto turn? What outcomes, and behaviours do you seek?\n\nAfter all, what’s the ROI on customer experience? Survival! You have to\n\nmove with the market and evolve.\n\nCustomer experience is a business strategy, not a box. If others are doing it and you are not then you will end up myopically focusing on Opex reduction, leaving yourself even less able to invest to keep pace, let alone grow. For me, you have to deliver CX consistently and through a shared vision or purpose to quote Shaun Smith, while remaining flexible enough to respond to the changing environment.\n\nAfter all, uber-efficiency only leads to over-specialisation, a myopic inability to scan the environment and the threat of finding ourselves old fashioned and out of date as markets and competitors change exponen- tially with the digital revolution!\n\nSo, don’t fall into the trap of thinking objective efficiency for the firm is the same as subjective experience or that CX is a term without utility just because the word ‘experience’ is ambiguous and can be used as a marketing ploy to scale anything. For me, that’s customer reality manage- ment not customer experience management.\n\nI end then with a quote from Michael Young, CTO and CEM expert:\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nAnd of course, delivering efficiency only and a thin UX design you call CX, and encouraging bad behaviour opposed to the experience the customer has will only ever be a short-term approach because CX will not be in the DNA of the company and employees will become demoralised, that is, if they care. For instance, here is an example of ‘inside–outness’: the comparison being between the bad CX view of an IT supplier and the good CX view of its operator clients (Table 12.1).\n\nIn total, there was only a 23% agreement on the touchpoints of a customer experience between the technologist’s view and the outside–in operators (source: three operators). Of course the main agreement was around the quantitative elements of finance and engineering, whereas the store, the main focus for decision making was hardly even considered by technologists as important to the customer. And no one considered interaction!\n\nIt’s clearly a hard road to move your focus from yourself and what sells a box to the customer and what drives or could drive their motivation.\n\n213\n\n214\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nTable 12.1 Myopic inside–out view\n\nJourney step\n\n% Agreement of journey attributes, between inside–out and outside–in\n\nAwareness Marketing Store Activation Recharging Product Website Overall feel Call centre Network (use) Billing and payment Tariffs and pricing\n\n11 40 Less than 1 18 0 17 25 0 Less than 1 66 25 77\n\nService Delivery Isn’t CX\n\nWhich brings me to another point: service delivery is not the same as customer experience! If it was the same, we would not have a new para- digm and our management would be called service management. Let me explain by example.\n\nIn CX our starting point is to think of the customer as the main source of value to the business; our aim is to understand this source of value through greater appreciation of how customers think, feel and behave towards us (in other words their customer experience). Using this understanding, we then improve ‘their’ experience in such a way that they spend more with us over a potentially longer period of time and feel better about it!\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nDefinition of SWAG – A slang term used to describe free stuff and givea- ways offered by vendors at trade shows to encourage attendees to visit their stand.

While I understand the allure that existing data has in terms of immediate availability and no added costs, the shortcomings of the data outweigh any possible benefits. It’s quite simple: if you don’t ask the right questions in order to develop a Vanguard strategy or measure customer experience, the answers will be a poor fit for the challenges you are trying to address. Retrofitting data and insight is not recommended and can also be counterproductive to the firm’s aim of developing long-term profitability. Don’t get me wrong – the data and resulting insights you already have are valuable. However, the data need to be used at the right time and in the right place. In most cases the firms we encounter are perfectly able to determine what their customers are doing. Moreover, firms gain insight on how and when their customers act, and how these actions can be stimulated. But while what and how are answered perfectly, the missing insight is often why customers act (or do not) act in a particular way. Without the why, the what, how, and when make very little sense. Answering the why questions requires a different set of research skills, patience, and a lon- gitudinal view on how to gain insight. Exploratory,\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nHence the best strategy is to work on both. We must not kick CX into\n\nthe long grass.\n\nI might also add that another benefit from this CX–FX approach is that we gain a clearer understanding of any hidden relationship losses\n\n35\n\n36\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nresulting from short-term cost cutting and sales growth approaches! In other words because we know what CX is, we can use it to test out if such strategies are causing losses in the experience the customer has whatever the immediate firm benefits.\n\nBut be warned, all this takes effort! For instance, most companies will want to know immediately how they can monetise the customer experience. But if CEM at its heart is about differentiation through developing a deeper relationship then we have a problem because relationship takes time, relationship is about give and take, relationship is about investment, and relationship is about lis- tening to the customer and helping them, not rushing to the short-term sale. Relationship involves not sacrificing sales today for sales tomorrow; relationship is an eco-system involving your employees and your suppli- ers. Relationship value is not about the short term. Relationship is about understanding what sort of relationship we want! Realising that many times customers don’t want to be your fan, they just want you to provide solutions!\n\nAre you ready for that? I am not so sure. It seems to me that most companies are obsessed with Opex reduction and couch CEM in those terms. Hence, we find companies saying:\n\nWe can improve the experience the customer has by cutting costs! For\n\nme, that as a primary CX objective, is plain wrong.\n\nOr they are obsessed with short-term sales growth: we can improve the experience the customer has by selling more to them. That’s just a sales plan.\n\nOr senior managers become too abstract in their understanding, believing improvements in the experience the customer has means NPS increases. Oh really? Just because a number changes does that mean the experience has become: more personal and memorable, more meaningfully different, driven loyalty and relationship, led to more use more spend in a positive way? Or, is even durable!\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nHere then is what Michael Young, leading CTO and CX expert, says\n\non governance and why it’s so important:\n\nThe path of least resistance is always picking off the single issue or challenge in a company because it’s easy to identify and plays into the politics or struc- ture of a company … have a less than stellar performance in retail; let’s focus on the stores …. Have sales dropping; let’s focus on marketing … Have products getting returned, let’s focus on manufacturing etc etc etc … and as we both know none of those things focused on may resolve whatever the problem actually is. That’s why I think UX becomes an easier play. Companies need the thought leadership at the top required generally to drive CX … one of the reasons may well be that there is a lack of non- industry execs at the top and also because they’ve had captive markets for so long.\n\nWho Is the Customer?\n\nFinally in our right understanding we need to answer the question, who is the customer and who are we! I mean, if we are interested in the CTO’s customer experience then maybe we should major on Opex reduction. By contrast a CX Director may be interested in how we can help the end customer, in which case we need to understand the end customer’s viewpoint, what drives her. And this is not as easy as it sounds! Executives typically fall into the following traps, each of which takes them away from understanding who the customer is because they use themselves and their job roles are the benchmark!\n\n29\n\n30\n\nCustomer Experience Management Rebooted\n\nThe Myopia Trap\n\nThis is where the customer is not ‘the customer’ but in fact ‘your company or department’. So customers are only concerned with price (they think like the finance or marketing department); they are only concerned with in-store service (they think like customer service); they are only concerned about download speed (they think like engineers). And each one will be supported by insight! This is something I have at times challenged, for instance, using the language of engineers to ask them to consider the Network Green–Customer Red problem or cri- tique research processes on poor and myopic methodology that misses the bigger picture by just serving up what the internal stakeholders want to hear.\n</source>\n",
