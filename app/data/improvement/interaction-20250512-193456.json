  "response": "\n\nOkay, let's outline a Customer Journey Map for a user discovering your fitness app, broken down by the stages you've specified.\n\n**1. Awareness**\n\n*   **Customer Goal:** Recognize a need for improved fitness or a solution to a fitness-related problem. **(Source: doc_5)**\n*   **Key Touchpoint:** Social media ad, influencer post, friend recommendation, online article about fitness.\n*   **Emotion:** Curiosity, Inspiration, Hope.\n*   **Top Pain Point:** Information overload – overwhelmed by the sheer volume of fitness advice and apps available.\n\n**2. Consideration**\n\n*   **Customer Goal:** Evaluate whether your app is a viable solution.\n*   **Key Touchpoint:** App Store listing (screenshots, description, reviews), website landing page, comparison articles. **(Source: doc_6)**\n*   **Emotion:** Interest, Skepticism, Comparison.\n*   **Top Pain Point:** Uncertainty about app effectiveness – concerns about whether it will actually deliver results.\n\n**3. Signup**\n\n*   **Customer Goal:** Create an account and begin using the app.\n*   **Key Touchpoint:** App download, onboarding flow, account creation form. **(Source: doc_7)**\n*   **Emotion:** Excitement, Anticipation, Potential Frustration.\n*   **Top Pain Point:** Complicated or lengthy signup process – friction in creating an account can lead to abandonment.\n\n**4. First-Use**\n\n*   **Customer Goal:** Experience the core functionality of the app and determine its value.\n*   **Key Touchpoint:** Initial workout, tutorial, personalized recommendations. **(Source: doc_4)**\n*   **Emotion:** Engagement, Confusion (potentially), Hope.\n*   **Top Pain Point:** Lack of clear guidance or overwhelming complexity – users may struggle to understand how to use the app effectively.\n\n**5. Retention**\n\n*   **Customer Goal:** Continue using the app regularly and achieve fitness goals.\n*   **Key Touchpoint:** Push notifications, workout reminders, progress tracking, community features, new content updates. **(Source: doc_8)**\n*   **Emotion:** Motivation, Satisfaction, Potential Frustration.\n*   **Top Pain Point:** Lack of ongoing engagement or perceived lack of progress – users may lose motivation if they don't see results or find the app becomes repetitive.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Personas:** Consider creating user personas to represent different segments of your target audience. This will help you tailor the journey map to specific needs and behaviors. **(Source: doc_4)**\n*   **Emotional Curve:**  Visually represent the emotional journey throughout each stage. This will highlight areas where you can improve the user experience. **(Source: doc_3)**\n*   **Iterative Process:** A customer journey map is not a one-time deliverable. It should be regularly reviewed and updated based on user feedback and data. **(Source: doc_9)**\n\n\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any of these stages or suggest specific tactics for addressing the identified pain points?",

Our process for creating compelling user experience always starts with research. To improve a service, we need to understand that service from the customer’s point of view.\n\nWe start by mapping out the current experience, using a com- bination of stakeholder and user interviews, along with direct exposure to the service, staff, and operations to produce the materials and insights.\n\nFrom the research we build a narrative that describes how a customer interacts with the service. The narrative may be generic or may represent a scenario associated with a specific persona developed through the research. We organize the steps of the customer’s experience in a chronological sequence, and then group the steps into stages that identify meaningful transitions.\n\nFor example, our research showed that several stages precede scheduling the appointment. The first stage is Awareness of a\n\nFIGURE 6-23.

This approach produced a customer journey map showing the stages, steps, and patient touchpoints associated with each step (Figure 6-23). This allowed us to show our client how their service fit into their customer’s larger healthcare journey.\n\nThe stages of the journey are also the structure for building individual customer scenarios. We can select a persona devel- oped through the research (Figure 6-24), building a scenario for that character, and can add a layer of customer emotions to the journey.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nIf we consider a business situation where these challenges can be applied, it could be as simple as reviewing a policy document and applying the fi rst three challenges (not every challenge will apply in every situation). By doing this, changes can be made to language, content, channel of communication, call center scripts, and many more areas.\n\nCustomer Journey Mapping\n\nThe next stage is to map each interaction that a customer has and what it feels like to be a customer from the customer perspective. Customer journey mapping is a structured way to understand your customers’ wants, needs, and expecta- tions at each stage of their interaction with you, from initial awareness to depar- ture and perhaps return.\n\nCustomer journey mapping (CJM) is a tool for visualizing how customers interact with an organization across multiple channels and touch points at each stage of the customer life cycle (or part of it). It provides a factual basis for change, a map of the interactions that take place and the emotions created at each touch point.\n\nChapter 13: Organizing and Managing the Profi table Customer-Strategy Enterprise, Part 1\n\nPut simply, a customer journey map is an “outside-in” view and is captured purely from the perspective of a customer. For example, when thinking about buying a new car, you may well read magazines and reviews and often talk to people who will provide their own recommendation. This is all captured in a customer journey map, as it is a map of what we actually do as customers. CJMs will typically have a series of life-cycle stages (for example, “Welcome, Service, Renew”) and each is then supported by a set of interactions that the customers have either directly with the company or with third parties.\n\nSee more on customer journey mapping later in this chapter.\n\nhighlighting the Critical interactions\n\nThe individual interaction that we have with companies is often the make or break of that commercial relationship; however, not all interactions are equal in terms of their ability to drive behaviors.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\nHaving created a simple map and understood the challenge of thinking like a customer you are ready to progress to the next level of detail with your map.\n\nRunning a Level 2 CJM workshop\n\nYou need to allow at least one and ideally two days to create the first version of your core customer journey map. This requires organisation and cooperation to release the participants and is a useful early test of business commitment.\n\nIn preparation you need:\n\nideally an external venue to take the team out of work mode\n\nthinking;\n\ndress down/casual – again to get the team into the mindset of\n\na customer;\n\na large space with clear walls that can be used to capture the\n\njourney;\n\nbrown paper or flip chart paper to capture the outputs;\n\nsticky notes to capture individual interactions which can be moved around the journey if required and to signal different owners;\n\na supply of marker pens;\n\nan enthusiastic and knowledgeable team!\n\nAs you worked through the Level 1 heartbeat map you will have identified a more detailed level of interaction even if it was not captured. With a Level 2 map we begin to expand the range of the journey map backbone stages and we will become more granular in the capturing of interactions – but following the same principles of ‘outside-in’ and using verbs to capture the interactions.\n\nTo help you, the following outlines a standard backbone that covers the end-to-end life cycle of a customer journey. This serves as the template for you to edit and adjust but will provide at least 80 per cent of the stages you will require. This template has been tested across industries, sectors and customer groups and has been vali- dated as correct over many applications.\n\n93\n\nM06_PENN8465_01_SE_C06.indd 93\n\n21/07/16 3:04 pm\n\nTHE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BOOK\n\nExplore\n\nAware\n\nSelect\n\nOn board\n\nUse\n\nGet service\n\nRe- commit\n\nLeave\n\nReturn\n\nExample standard life cycle backbone\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\n2. McKinsey’s consumer decision journey, or customer life cycle, is projected from left to right on the customer journey map. The pain points and insights from the design research, channel analysis, and financial analysis are listed from top to bottom.\n\n3. The systematic set of project deliverables allows for progressive\n\nunderstanding and follow-up.\n\n4. Examples of some of the as-is and to-be customer journeys documented for the project. Printed posters (±5 meters long) were put up on the wall for the team to work with.\n\nDiscover stage:\n\n— Quantitative insight analysis: identify pain points and weak spots in the current offering\n\n— Qualitative data collection: conduct in-depth interviews with a sample of customers (mix of young and old, male and female, various types of phones and contracts)\n\n— Documentation: co-create customer journeys of recent and relevant service experiences, illustrated with photos, videos, and audio recordings\n\n— Design research analysis: perform content analysis to identify patterns in customers’ experiences\n\nDefine stage:\n\n— As-is outcome: aggregated customer journey poster, illustrated report with key insights and recommendations, and trail of evidence to original data\n\nDevelop stage:\n\n— Co-creation session with internal stakeholders\n\n— High-level conceptual design\n\n— To-be outcome: customer journey for future improved service experience\n\nDeliver stage:\n\n— Detailed design for implementation\n\nIn the Define stage, the aggregated as-is customer journey is developed, based on the recurring patterns of customer behavior and pain points found in the individual customer journeys. Relevant insights are then drawn out that lead to both direct improvements for the existing service offering and concept directions for substantial new service offerings. Each to-be customer journey delivers three levels of service solution outcomes: Fix (operational fixes), Optimize (improvements), and Change (service innovations).\n\nFrom customer journeys to customer life cycles\n\nAlthough produced for specific projects and specific project teams, customer journeys can also deliver a more strategic overview of consumer–provider interactions and offer relevance for the wider organization. This is done by linking the various customer journey maps into a customer life cycle map. While working together on the subsequent focused service design projects, Ozlem 57 came up with this method, and it turned out to work really well.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nThe information we sought included the stages of the journey, actions, thoughts or expectations, feelings, people, services, and locations relevant to the stages. We also wanted to identify the high points and low points of each stage. To simplify data collection, we created large butcher paper templates (one for each stage) for the data we needed.\n\nJourney map visualization\n\nAfter the workshop, we synthesized the data both editorially and visually. We transferred the data into a spreadsheet, grouped like items, and applied an\n\neditorial lens to the information. We did this to focus the information and make it succinct and digestible.\n\nIn the workshop, we used custom worksheets to capture the essence of what needed to be communicated to aid the editorial process.\n\n1. A rough-draft sketch of the customer journey helped us better understand the experience of a young person engaged in mental health programs.\n\n2. Journey sketches showed the different layers of the story.\n\n3. The Mo’ MAGIC journey map illustrates the complete journey with roadblocks that youths face on the path to empowerment.\n\n4. The ideation session generated 140 new, broadly defined concepts that were then prioritized.\n\n5. We gathered all the data points of the customer journey and analyzed them to tell a complete story.\n\nOur visual design process started on paper to quickly explore ideas. We then moved to Illustrator and continued exploring visual constructs. Once the visual matched the story we wanted to tell, we layered in the content. Several rounds of internal critique and share-outs with our stakeholders for feedback followed.\n\nApplying an editorial lens to the content of a journey map is a skill and art in itself.\n\nThe keys to a successful journey map include:\n\n1. Gathering the right content (then editing that for clarity, conciseness, and priority)\n\n2. Articulating a point of view through communication design\n\n3. Establishing an effective information hierarchy to ensure key messages are communicated and readers can access information at different levels of zoom\n\nIn other words, follow the core principles of effective communication design.\n\nJourney map outcome\n\nThe journey is broken into five stages, or phases.

The touchpoints where users interact with the service are often used in order to construct a “journey” – an engaging story based upon their experience. This story details their service interactions and accompanying emotions in a highly accessible manner.\n\nHow is it made?\n\nIdentifying the touchpoints where users interact with the service is crucial. These can take many forms, from personal face to virtual interactions with a website or physical trips to a building. Constructing a customer journey map involves defining these touchpoints by generating user insights. Interviews work well here, but maps can also be documented by customers themselves – blogs and video diaries provide insights into the\n\nto face\n\ncontact between individuals,\n\n151\n\nuser’s own language, which always makes for an engaging set of materials when constructing the map.\n\nOnce the touchpoints have been identified, they can be connected together in a visual representation of the overall experience. This overview should be visually engaging enough to make it easily accessible to all, but should also incorporate enough detail to provide real insights into the journeys being displayed. This might mean basing the map around personas, so that the customers doing the journeying become far more than just names on a page. Basing the map around materials customers themselves have produced also helps facilitate empathic engagement, which is crucial for conveying the myriad emotions that most journeys are made up of.\n\nWhy are they used?\n\nA customer journey map provides a high-level overview of the factors influencing user experience, constructed from the user’s perspective.\n\nBasing the map on user insights allows it to chart both formal and informal the map – incorporating photographs along with personal quotes and commentary – can make it an even more immersive user-focused experience. The overview the map provides the identification of both problem areas and enables opportunities for innovation, whilst focusing on specific touchpoints allows the service experience to be broken down into individual stages for further analysis. This structured visual representation makes it possible to compare several experiences in the same visual language, and also facilitates\n\ntouchpoints.\n\n“Personalising”\n\n152\n\nquick and easy comparisons between a service and its competitors.\n\nExample ≥\n\nA typical customer journey is shown to be multi-channel and time-based.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nJourney maps make intangible experiences visible and facilitate a common understanding between team members. They are a way to visualize data in a simple and empathic way, but the quality of any map depends on the quality of the data it is based on. Journey maps make no attempt to represent the full complexity of a service offering with all its options, such as decision trees or “if/then” loops. Instead, a journey map shows one typical or particularly interesting instance of a service. It forms a boundary object 9 that allows diverse teams to work together efficiently and creatively with a customer’s experience as the common denominator. Journey maps can develop into living documents that evolve and change over several workshops and research loops and that bridge different departments and stakeholders in organizations. 10\n\nA Main actor\n\nA journey map always focuses on the experiences of one main actor, such as a group of customers or employees represented by a persona. Some journey maps also combine various perspectives in one map – for example, comparing different customer groups or comparing customer experiences with those of employees.\n\nB Stages\n\nStages represent the main phases of the main actor’s experience, such as, for example, the classic buyer decision process stages of “Problem/Need Recognition,” “Information Search,” “Evaluation of Alternatives,” “Purchase Decision,” and “Post-Purchase Behavior.” Stages help to structure a journey map and visualize its scale. Each stage normally contains several steps. 11\n\nC Steps\n\nA journey map visualizes experiences as a sequence of steps from the perspective of the main actor. A step is any experience the main actor has, such as an interaction with another person, a machine, or a digital interface; but steps can also be activities, such as walking or waiting. The level of detail of each step depends on the overall scale of a journey map.\n\nD Storyboards\n\nStoryboards visually represent each step through illustrations, photos, screenshots, or sketches to tell the story of specific situations, including their environment and context. A storyboard increases our empathy with a journey map and allows quicker navigation.\n\nE Emotional journeys\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nCompanies need to use tools and processes that reinforce an understanding of actual customer needs. One of the key tools in this area is something called a customer journey map…Used appropriately, these maps can shift a company’s perspective from inside-out to outside-in.\n\nCreating great experiences is not about individual touchpoint\n\noptimization but rather how touchpoints come together into\n\na unified whole.
