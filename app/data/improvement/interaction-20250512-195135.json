  "response": "\n\nYes, we were discussing Return on Investment (ROI) and related frameworks within the context of customer experience (CX).

You are told you will scream in pain and beg the surgeon to stop. However, you are promised an amnesia-inducing drug that will completely wipe out any memory of the episode. How do you feel about such a prospect? Here again, my informal observation is that most people are remarkably indifferent to the pains of their experiencing self. Some say they don’t care at all. Others share my feeling, which is that I feel pity for my suffering self but not more than I would feel for a stranger in pain. Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.\n\nSpeaking of Life as a Story\n\n“He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.”\n\n“The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.”\n\n“You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?”\n\n“She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”\n\nExperienced Well-Being\n\nWhen I became interested in the study of well-being about fifteen years ago, I quickly found out that almost everything that was known about the subject drew on the answers of millions of people to minor variations of a survey question, which was generally accepted as a measure of happiness. The question is clearly addressed to your remembering self, which is invited to think about your life:\n\nAll things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?\n\nHaving come to the topic of well-being from the study of the mistaken memories of colonoscopies and painfully cold hands, I was naturally suspicious of global satisfaction with life as a valid measure of well-being. As the remembering self had not proved to be a good witness in my experiments, I focused on the well-being of the experiencing self. I proposed that it made sense to say that “Helen was happy in the month of March” if\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\ntons of questions, I had all the answers at my fingertips. At the end of the call, they thanked me profusely for my time. And the vice president's final words were, \"We'll definitely be getting back to you.\" I was so proud of how well things had gone that I could almost feel my head swell as I started to hang up the phone. But then .. . instead of pushing the \"off\" button on the phone, I accidentally hit the \"mute\" button. I didn't realize it until I heard them con tinuing to talk. They hadn't hung up, but they thought I had. And what do you think they were saying about our oh-so-promising phone conversation? \"OK.\" It was the vice-president's voice. \"So we're definitely not going to go with him. But keep stringing him along. Get more information so we can get a better deal with another company.\"\n\nOuch. I was devastated. My first feeling was outrage that they had lied to me. I felt hurt and used, but the feelings of rejection that s,wept over me were even worse. \"I'm a good guy,\" I told myself. \"I did everything right. I've studied all the best sales pro grams in the world. I didn't cut any corners. Why are they treating me this way?\"\n\nThen I remembered a lot of other times when I had gotten a gut feeling that something was \"off\" about how a prospect was reacting to me. I could never put my finger on it, but at some level I knew that everything I had learned was incomplete. But I ignored that nagging discomfort and kept on doing what I had been doing- until that \"wake-up call.\"\n\nYou know, a lot of sales programs today would look at that call and say: \"If a prospect lies to you, it's okay to lie back. If they're aggressive to you, it's okay to be aggressive back, because that's how you can control the situation. If they try to box you in, it's okay to force them into a commitment.\"\n\nBut this buyer and seller conflict, battle) whatever you want to call it, just felt so\n\nwrong.\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out one basic truth that none of those\n\n\"fight-back\" sales programs ever talked about:\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\nI countered a prospect's perfectly natural skepticism by saying, \"Sure, I could lie to you and send you just anybody, and take your money tonight. But then you'd never call us back, would you? But ifI'm honest with you and send the type of girl who is just as I describe her, you'll know you can trust us and you'll call us again. That's my goal-for you to call us back. And for you to tell your friends about us too. You'd never do that ifI ripped you off, would you?\"\n\nCHAPTER 6/ Creating and Directing the Movie in Your Customer's Mind\n\n78 xu UNCENSORED SALES STRATEGIES\n\nRemember, these guys were businessmen and they had that same long range outlook too. They understood the importance of building a relation ship, and that repeat business is critical if you plan on being around for the long haul.\n\nWhile it is unlikely the field you're in has as dismal a reputation as the one I was, you are still going to encounter skepticism from time to time. Honesty is really the best policy; if you talk with your customers the way I talked to mine and make it clear that their satisfaction is extremely important to you because you want to do business with them again, they will usually make the leap. And remember the value of-a good guarantee, which takes the fear out of the risk of making a mistake.\n\nHonesty Is the Best Policy One of the most effective ways to manage negative expectations is to let the customer know right up front about any possible dubious aspects of doing business with YQU. Southwest Airlines is commonly cited as a classic example of a company that delivers a less-than-ideal experience with negligible cus tomer dissatisfaction. Southwest lets their prospects and customers know right from the get-go that there are no assigned seats, no free food or bever ages, and that they are going to stuff as many people into that airplane as they possibly can. Nobody complains because they know that's what they're get ting before they even buy the ticket. If American Airlines were to do that, there would be an enormous hue and cry, with people ranting and snarling and car rying on, not to mention letters to the FAA and nasty blog postings.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nLet me share a story from the research. At a pivotal point in the study, members of the research team nearly revolted. Throwing their interview notes on the table, they asked, \"Do we have to keep asking that stupid question?\"\n\n\"What stupid question?\" I asked. \"The one about commitment, alignment, and how they managed\n\nchange.\"\n\n\"That's not a stupid question,\" I replied. \"It's one of the most im-\n\nportant.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said one team member, \"a lot of the executives who made the transition-well, they think it's a stupid question. Some don't even under- stand the question!\"\n\n\"Yes, we need to keep asking it,\" I said. \"We need to be consistent across the interviews. And, besides, it's even more interesting that they don't\n\n175\n\n176\n\nlim Collins\n\nunderstand the question. So, keep probing. We've got to understand how they overcame resistance to change and got people lined up.\"\n\nI fully expected to find that getting everyone lined up-\"creating align- ment,\" to use the jargon-would be one of the top challenges faced by executives working to turn good into great. After all, nearly every executive who'd visited the laboratory had asked this question in one form or another. \"How do we get the boat turned?\" \"How do we get people com- mitted to the new vision?\" \"How do we motivate people to line up?\" \"How do we get people to embrace change?\"\n\nTo my great surprise, we did not find the question of alignment to be a\n\nkey challenge faced by the good-to-great leaders.\n\nConsider Kroger. How do you get a company of over 50,000 people- cashiers, baggers, shelf stockers, produce washers, and so forth-to embrace a radical new strategy that will eventually change virtually every aspect of how the company builds and runs grocery stores? The answer is that you don't. Not in one big event or program, anyway.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nSo, if you asked me ‘What I remember,’ here are the things I would say: The fact I had to throw away a personal item (the over 100-ml can of shaving foam) is one. Then there is the near argument with the currency rep. I think it would also be the long queues at the ATM because of the breakdown and the way I got around this. Then there are the £1 plastic bag\n\n10 The Value of Emotions\n\ncontainers and the social sense from others that Luton is not a great airport. However, I have to say there are a number of other positive emotional needs that were satisfied. So, the convenience of getting to the airport, the fact there were few queues is critical. The fact that I avoid having to go to Heathrow! (Emotions are set in context.)\n\nSo personal loss would be the first thing, followed by emotionally diffi- cult situations, especially in face-to-face situations; then some positive if muted, in this case, moments of ease.\n\nBut there is also another aspect to this. Visual memory is important; emotional memories come with a sense of place. So the bland aesthetic and functional atmosphere does nothing to amplify the good memories but certainly justifies the bad or bland! It seems even if we design it or not, there is always an emotional experience.\n\nIn all this I build a sense of whether this is a good place to do business in or not; I build a disposition: ‘If I go there then I will feel’ a certain sense. And because emotions are tied in to what we remember this is important for decision making.\n\nBut in addition, there are a lot of nonconscious emotional effects we\n\nhave to consider, things that weight the experience.\n\nAnd this is also important, I mean perhaps next time the emotional weighting remains with the convenient location and I don’t care about the rest!\n\nHence, what I say on 19 December 2015 when I am thinking of going from Luton Airport again is: well, the emotional drive remains; it’s a great location for me, I can avoid Heathrow.\n\nSo I would still use it.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nLike Wurtzel, leaders in each of the good-to-great transitions oper- ated with a somewhat Socratic style. Furthermore, they used questions for one and only one reason: to gain understanding. They didn't use questions as a form of manipulation (\"Don't you agree with me on that? . . .\") or as a way to blame or put down others (\"Why did you mess this up? . . .\"). When we asked the executives about their management team meetings during the transition era, they said that they spent much of the time \"just trying to understand.\"\n\nThe good-to-great leaders made particularly good use of informal meetings where they'd meet with groups of managers and employees with no script, agenda, or set of action items to discuss. Instead, they would start with questions like: \"So, what's on your mind?\" \"Can you tell me about that?\" \"Can you help me understand?\" \"What should we be worried about?\" These non-agenda meetings became a forum where current realities tended to bubble to the surface.\n\n2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.\n\nIn 1965, you could hardly find a company more awful than Nucor. It had only one division that made money. Everything else drained cash. It had no culture to be proud of. It had no consistent direction. It was\n\n75\n\n76\n\nlim Collins\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nHere again, as we did for the illusion, we can ask: Are the students confused? Do they really think that the two questions—the one they were asked and the one they answer—are synonymous? Of course not. The students do not temporarily lose their ability to distinguish romantic life from life as a whole. If asked about the two concepts, they would say they are different. But they were not asked whether the concepts are different. They were asked how happy they were, and System 1 has a ready answer. Dating is not unique. The same pattern is found if a question about the students’ relations with their parents or about their finances immediately In both cases, precedes satisfaction in the particular domain dominates happiness reports. Any emotionally significant question that alters a person’s mood will have the same effect. WYSIATI. The present state of mind looms very large when people evaluate their happiness.\n\nthe question about general happiness.\n\nThe Affect Heuristic\n\nThe dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an affect heuristic in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the arguments that you find compelling. If you like the current health policy, you\n\nthe world. Your political preference determines\n\nbelieve its benefits are substantial and its costs more manageable than the costs of alternatives. If you are a hawk in your attitude toward other nations, you probabltheр\"0%y think they are relatively weak and likely to submit to your country’s will. If you are a dove, you probably think they are strong and will not be easily coerced. Your emotional attitude to such things as irradiated food, red meat, nuclear power, tattoos, or motorcycles drives your beliefs about their benefits and their risks. If you dislike any of these things, you probably believe that its risks are high and its benefits negligible.\n\nThe primacy of conclusions does not mean that your mind is completely closed and that your opinions are wholly immune to information and sensible reasoning. Your beliefs, and even your emotional attitude, may change (at least a little) when you learn that the risk of an activity you disliked is smaller than you thought. However, the information about lower risks will also change your view of the benefits (for the better) even if nothing was said about benefits in the information you received.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nLikewise, in the early years of Amazon, the e-commerce retailer sent coffee mugs to loyal customers around the Christmas holidays. We received such a mug and 15 years later remember it well enough to write about it in this book!\n\nFor repeat customers within customer life cycle management, cre- ating treatment strategies would involve understanding customers from a value, behavior, engagement, product, and brand perspectives, similar to what we outlined in the chapter where we discussed clustering.\n\nInactive Customer Strategies: Remember Me\n\nDon’t give up on inactive customers. Just because they haven’t bought anything for a while doesn’t mean they won’t ever buy anything from you. The first thing to do is to investigate if there is a specific rea- son why this customer stopped buying or using your product or ser- vice. You can do this by picking up the phone or via an email survey. Don’t make assumptions. One vendor we do business with was trying to be ultra customer-centric by proactively unsubscribing consumers from their email list if they hadn’t opened these emails for a while. Many cus- tomers who were unsubscribed automatically were upset. Even though they hadn’t bought for a while, many said they still enjoyed reading the newsletter and had every intention of buying again.\n\nThe sooner you act on inactive customers, the better. Don’t wait for them to lapse. Offer constant gentle reminders of the great past expe- riences they have had with your brand and provide a gentle nudge to come back again. Just like a simple “thank you” and “can I help” goes a long way, a simple reminder can work wonders for inactive customers. Music app Shazam found the best way to re-engage subscribers that hadn’t logged into the service for a while was to send personalized\n\n113\n\n114\n\nNine Easy Plays to Get Started with Predictive Marketing\n\nrecommendations for songs or concerts via email or mobile push notifications.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\n\"But it seems to me,\" countered Brian Larsen, \"that our technology finding is just a special case of disciplined action, and it belongs in the previous chapter. Disciplined action means staying within the three cir- cles, and that's the essence of our technology finding.\"\n\n\"True, but it is a very special case,\" pointed out Scott Cederberg. \"Every one of the companies became extreme pioneers in the application of tech- nology long before the rest of the world became technology obsessed.\"\n\n\"But compared to other findings like Level 5, the Hedgehog Concept, and 'first who,' technology feels like a much smaller issue,\" retorted Amber Young. \"I agree with Brian: Technology is important, but as a sub- set of discipline or perhaps the flywheel.\"\n\nWe argued throughout the summer. Then Chris Jones, in her typically\n\n159\n\n160\n\n]in Collins\n\nquiet and thoughtful way, asked a key question: \"Why did the good-to- great companies maintain such a balanced perspective on technology, when most companies become reactionary, lurching and running about like Chicken Little, as we're seeing with the Internet?\"\n\nWhy indeed. Chris's question led us to an essential difference between great compa- nies and good companies, a difference that ultimately tipped the balance in favor of including this chapter.\n\nIf you had the opportunity to sit down and read all 2,000+ pages of tran- scripts from the good-to-great interviews, you'd be struck by the utter absence of talk about \"competitive strategy.\" Yes, they did talk about strat- egy, and they did talk about performance, and they did talk about becom- ing the best, and they even talked about winning. But they never talked in reactionary terms and never defined their strategies principally in response to what others were doing. They talked in terms of what they were trying to create and how they were trying to improve relative to an absolute standard of excellence.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nFor example, students of policy have noted that the availability heuristic helps explain why some issues are highly salient in the public’s mind while others are neglected. People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common. For several weeks after Michael Jackson’s death, for example, it was virtually impossible to find a television channel reporting on another topic. In contrast, there is little coverage of critical but unexciting issues that provide less drama, such as declining educational standards or overinvestment of medical resources in the last year of life. (As I write this, I notice that my choice of “little-covered” examples was guided by availability. The topics I chose as examples are mentioned often; equally important issues that are less available did not come to my mind.)\n\nWe did not fully realize it at the time, but a key reason for the broad appeal of “heuristics and biases” outside psychology was an incidental feature of our work: we almost always included in our articles the full text of the questions we had asked ourselves and our respondents. These questions served as demonstrations for the reader, allowing him to recognize how his own thinking was tripped up by cognitive biases. I hope you had such an experience as you read the question about Steve the librarian, which was intended to help you appreciate the power of resemblance as a cue to probability and to see how easy it is to ignore relevant statistical facts.\n</source>\n",
