  "question": "ill need you to create a document soon but just ready yourself and understand how to make a ROI document",
  "response": "Okay, I'm preparing to help you create a compelling ROI document. Here's a breakdown of key considerations, drawing from my knowledge base:\n\n**1. Documentation is Key (and Plan Ahead)**\n\nDocumentation should be a priority from the start. Decide early on how you'll organize and create your written project documentation, checking for requirements (e.g., from your project sponsor). Build documentation into activities as much as possible to keep your memory fresh **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**2. Documenting Process & Decisions**\n\nIt's crucial to document changes and the reasons behind them. This can be as simple as meeting minutes or photos of flipcharts. Undocumented decisions can lead to challenges and rework **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**3. Tangible Outputs & Traceability**\n\nDocument tangible outputs (prototypes, etc.) and connect them back to the underlying research and insights. A simple indexing system can help with this traceability **(Source: doc_1)**.\n\n**4. Release Management & Testing**\n\nAs you move towards release, establish a testing routine and communicate changes to users. A staging environment is helpful for testing before production **(Source: doc_2)**.\n\n**5. Showcasing Impact & Raising Awareness**\n\nTo demonstrate ROI, document your project throughout, including before-and-after states (if possible with measurable impact). Use visuals like photos and videos to showcase your work **(Source: doc_3)**.\n\n**6. Financial Justification**\n\nA successful customer strategy requires a clear financial justification for the efforts. Document why you're making these changes and be ready to measure the impact **(Source: doc_9)**.\n\n**7. Making it Easy to Understand**\n\nWhen presenting your ROI, make it easy to understand. Use visuals, icons, and graphics to communicate your goals and strategies to everyone in the organization **(Source: doc_10)**.\n\n\n\nTo help me tailor the ROI document creation process further, could you tell me:\n\n*   What specific project or initiative is this ROI document for?\n*   What are the primary goals of this project?\n*   Who is the intended audience for the document?",
  "context": "<source id=\"doc_1\" name=\"doc_1\">\nFigure 9-11. FLOW OF EMPATHY Handover through documents will not carry over empathy. Keep up the flow of empathy by keeping key people in the project from beginning to end.\n\nDocumentation Decide early how you are going to organize and create your written 88 project documentation. Check (e.g., with your project sponsor) whether or not there are any requirements on form and content. Depending on the industry you work in, there might be strict rules and obligations. Documentation can be tedious and hard work, especially if it is done in retrospect, so plan this well ahead of time. Build it into the activities themselves as much as possible, or at least do it while your memory is still fresh.\n\nDocument your process and decisions\n\nThe service design process is adaptive and iterative. As you are constantly reviewing your progress and making changes, the real process will deviate from your original plan. As you go along, create concise documentation of the changes you made and the underlying reasons. This can be as simple as filing handwritten meeting minutes, or just taking photos of flipcharts or sticky notes that contain those details. However, it might also be necessary to prepare a glossy slide deck to run a decision past the board or to follow an official template for change requests.\n\nImportant decisions that are undocumented might be challenged, creating unnecessary discussions or, in the worst case, forcing you to do over.\n\nDocument your tangible outputs\n\nMost activities in the service design process have tangible outputs which in turn act as the inputs for the next set of activities. These outputs are important for your documentation as they allow you to trace back outputs like prototypes to the underlying insights from research or even back to the original quotes from your research data. 89 A simple indexing system can help to connect the original data from your research to your prototypes or implemented solutions.\n\nExpert Tip\n\n“It takes the whole organization to create and deliver services to market. The intangible benefits are equal to, if not more important than, the tangible outcomes, as without understanding and alignment, your team may contribute to creative pollution that never gets implemented.” — Jamin Hegeman\n\nIf a piece in the chain is challenged, you can retrace some steps and re- examine the underlying assumptions or conclusions, or explain where it came from and who contributed. 90\n\nKeep the documentation accessible\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nprototyping activities when working on any bigger feature (they are usually called “epics”) that is going into implementation. This section ends where most resources on Scrum, Kanban, and so on usually begin: with the product backlog. After finishing research, ideation, and prototyping, the results should be summarized in a requirements document. Together with the engineering team, schedule a planning session to create a list of tasks or stories that need be worked on to fulfill the requirements in the epic. Then follow whichever approach works best for your team and iteratively implement the features. Define deadlines, estimate the effort, and make sure that any area of uncertainty is touched as soon as possible to avoid blockers at the end of the development cycle.\n\nAim for a demo day at least once per week where product managers and lead developers check in on the progress and give early feedback. Again, seeing is believing. By collecting early feedback from stakeholders, you can avoid expensive feedback loops right before the feature release. The aim of every iteration should be a running, usable piece of software.\n\nRelease\n\nThe complexity of your release management activities will depend on the stage of your project. While in early prototyping you might just throw away everything and start from scratch, this will not be possible when users are relying on your product. What is a “test” for you is a finished product for them. As soon as you start to have users actually using your service, consider the following:\n\n→ Have a testing routine: No matter if you go with automated tests from the start, have someone testing the features, or do it yourself, document your testing routine and do it carefully to avoid critical bugs appearing in production. Ideally, set up a “staging environment” where people can test everything, like for the “real thing” in production.\n\n→ Communicate properly: Let users know what’s going to happen. Will the update break something they were used to? Will your service go offline for some hours?\n\n→ Make releases robust: Whether you’re building a mobile app, a\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\nthese before and after the project to understand and prove its impact. Document your project throughout the entire process using photos, videos, quotes from participants, and artifacts like personas or journey maps, as well as measuring potential impacts of your project. Remember to keep doing this as you approach the end of a project, when other things become very important. This is not only crucial to showcase your project and way of working to others, but also to celebrate the successes with your team.\n\nRaise awareness When you have found “your” way of doing service design 7 through a series of small “stealth” projects and have developed management buy-in, you can start raising awareness within your organization. Good documentation of previous projects can help you do this organically. Project documentation should include the state of an experience before and after the project (if possible with a measurable impact) as well as the design process and how the team worked together. 8 Video summaries or short reports with plenty of photos usually work quite well, shared through a newsletter, an internal website, or a blog.\n\nExpert Tip\n\n“A quick way to gain management support early on is to know in advance some of management’s agenda. What do they really care about and what are their goals? Choosing projects that address those cares, goals, and concerns align the outcomes of a service design project to management reality and increases management buy-in.” — Fernando Yepez\n\nAnother approach is to casually showcase high-fidelity journey or system maps that address a specific experience before and after a project – perhaps by hanging them in your office and even in hallways or coffee areas. 9 It helps if these maps are self-explanatory. Also, you can provide some general information on the project and particularly on the process the team went through.\n\nProject participants from various departments and backgrounds can team up to educate others through demonstrations. The goal is not to up-skill non- designers to designers, but to create champions of the process throughout an organization. Explaining a project and the design process to others often brings better understanding for those who have to present, and stories from your own organization are better for promoting service design than cases from other companies. Make clear that service design works in your\n\norganization, in your structures, in your culture.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nAlternatively I could focus my efforts not on the product (bread) but on making the environment attractive to footfall; such as opening a spe- ciality Austrian in-store bread bakery; creating an ‘experience’ not just managing the experience. Likewise, similar to Domino’s Pizza, I could make visits to local schools to show how bread is made or like Metro Bank, where school trips go to the bank vaults, I could encourage visits to a Warburton’s bakery.\n\nAnd how about Warburton’s interaction with the shop itself; are there\n\nany B2B activities that could create more of a relationship?\n\nOr perhaps if we look from the point of view of the store, could a man- ager here make the more general bread-buying experience better; perhaps by focusing on the whole customer journey, for instance, friendliness of staff, ease of parking and so forth; all indirectly impactful on buying a loaf of bread, but influential none the less.\n\nSo next time you go to the supermarket, ask yourself the questions: what is the ROI of the music playing in the background, the ambience, the friendliness of the customer service reps, the ease of finding what you want, the ability to find a parking space, the wait time at the till and the way they interact with you. It’s not so easy to put a figure on these things individually, but consider what the environment would be like without them!\n\nPrice and product are not the only things that drive or could drive\n\nROI. And even these are subject to subjective interpretation!\n\nHence we need and must understand subjectivity to do customer expe- rience. And because managers are so used to looking at data as objective it is important for us to understand the difference in how subjective data behave, lest we treat subjective data as objective and end up with a grey experience competing only on price and product features! Or treat the intangible as tangible and end up buying an IT system.\n\nOf course I know what you are going to say: if we can find more effi- cient ways to make bread we could cut the price. Or we could provide it cheaper by using lower quality grains. To which I say, no one said\n\n4 Right Data\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\n3This is what happens to many marketing concepts. You can’t scale an idea or expertise, but you can scale software. So, if we take the experience the customer has, then feed it through the mincer, TQMing it, breaking it down into components and in the process miss out on how cognition really works, we can measure and monitor it. And voila we have a prac- tice. This has the unfortunate effect of giving us false hope while at the same time failing to account for experience losses.\n\n4Customer experience has become a general term for: (1) service design, (2) seeing things through the customer’s eyes and (3) serving up any old thing as ‘selling experience’. Apart from the last item, this is not a bad thing. But it does mean it holds little difference in meaning from say service and customer research! Hence, service design should really be experience design. In addition, the complexity of digitalisation and multichannel inte- gration has meant that the words ‘customer experience’ are just useful terms with which to talk about user experience. This is all fine, but an over-brand is not enough, even if it does give a sense of mystique (not quite definable, slippery, can mean what you want, magical!). We need to consider the experience economy definition and how we can create an experience not manage one.\n\n5I am aware that relationship marketing is the origin here and that there is a clear ROI of CRM based on software. However, I stand by my comment: if you use a qualitative term like relationship then you need to demonstrate a qualitative benefit!\n\n6If you take a technology enabler to be ‘the customer experience’ you risk assuming that when the machine KPIs work well then the customer must be happy! This is not necessarily the case if the customer thinks of the ‘enablement’ as hygienic. And certainly not the case because no customer buys the tech enablement; they buy the benefit that’s derived. Likewise, where do you stop your technology enablement as an experi-\n\nence definition?\n\nA back-office document bill printer has a critical role to play in the experience of electricity and gas buying. Is this now a customer experi- ence solution?\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nKey questions when determining which experiences to map\n\nCreating personas is not creative writing. Personas should be\n\nare:\n\nbased on actual data. The process consists of the following\n\nWhich relationships in the customer value chain do you\n\nsteps.\n\nwant to focus on?\n\n1. Identify the most salient attributes that distinguish one\n\nWhat point of view do you want to understand in that\n\nsegment from another. You can usually find three to five\n\nrelationship?\n\nprimary attributes to focus on.\n\nWhich types of users or customers are most relevant?\n\n2. Determine the number of personas that you need to rep-\n\nWhich experiences are most appropriate to include?\n\nresent the range of attributes included. Collect data that\n\nsupports and describes those attributes. Of course, your\n\nWhere do those experiences begin and end?\n\ninvestigation may reveal new attributes to include along\n\nCreate Personas\n\nthe way.\n\n3. Draft the personas based on the primary attributes. Also\n\nPersonas are narrative descriptions of user archetypes reflect-\n\ninclude some basic aspects to flesh out the persona such\n\ning common patterns of behavior, needs, and emotions. They\n\nas demographics, behaviors, motivations, and pain points.\n\nreflect details about a target group in a way that is easy to\n\ngrasp.\n\n4. Finalize the persona. Create a compelling visualization of\n\nthe persona on a single page.

Figure 4-3 shows an example of a persona document I\n\ncreated for a past project.\n\n5. Make the personas visible. Hang them up in brainstorm-\n\ning sessions and include them in project documents.

For instance, Figure 4-4 shows a customer\n\njourney map created by Jim Tincher, founder of the Heart of the Customer, a consultancy specializing in journey mapping.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nPreparation: Prepare a wall space or large cardboard sheets to hang up your research data. Also, think about who should join you to create a research wall.\n\nUse: Hang the material on the wall and start synthesizing data by clustering it according to specific topics, like certain customer segments, common problems, steps along the journey map, etc. Name these clusters and look for connections between clusters as well as connections between single materials (be aware of a potential confirmation bias). The various patterns you identify can then be further explored with tools like personas, journey maps, system maps, key insights, and so on – all of which also become part of the research wall.\n\nComment\n\n“We started to document all our core customer experiences with current-state journey maps based on quantitative and predominantly qualitative research. Now that we know where we are, we can make educated decisions on what exactly needs improvement and why.” — Anke Helmbrecht\n\nExpected output: A visual arrangement of research data\n\nCreating personas\n\nCreating a rich description of a specific fictional person as an archetype exemplifying a group of people, such as a group of customers, users, or employees. 42\n\nPersonas focus on particular types of customer motivations and behaviors, and help to achieve empathy with a group of people to create solutions that address real problems. You can create them for existing market segments or to challenge an existing segmentation.\n\nPreparation: Persona templates or empathy maps are sometimes helpful when creating personas. You often mix different approaches – for example, starting with assumption-based personas developed during a co-creative workshop with frontline staff, then enriching and backing these with research.\n\nUse: Create approximately three to seven core personas representing your main market segments. Following the principle of “design for the average – test with extremes,” create many more “edge-of-the-curve” personas to test ideas and prototypes with people from more extreme ends of your user spectrum.\n\nExpected output: Personas\n\n1. Using foam boards as research walls helps a research team to keep research data (such as quotes, photos, screenshots, artifacts, etc.) with them when they have to move between rooms.\n\n2. Structure your research wall by clustering and adding headings to the different sections.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\ndocument and make at least one improvement every week that makes Zappos better. Ideally, we would do this every single day. It sounds daunting, but remember improvements don’t have to be dramatic. Think about what it means to improve just 1% per day and build upon that every single day. Doing so has a dramatic effect and will make us 37x better, not 365% (3.65x) better, at the end of the year.\n\nWake up every day and ask yourself not only what is the 1% improvement I can change to make Zappos better, but also what is the 1% improvement I can change to make myself better personally and professionally. In the end we, as Zappos, can’t grow unless we, as individuals, grow too.\n\nImagine yourself making 1% changes every day that compound and\n\nconsequently make you and Zappos 37x better by the end of the year. Imagine if every employee at Zappos was to do the same. Imagine how much better you, Zappos, and the world will be next year.\n\nIt won’t be easy and 2009 will no doubt present its own set of challenges, but we positively will get through it. Have a great and happy 2009!\n\nPS: This is for the math geeks. If you start out with $100 at the beginning of the year and you were able to increase what you have by 1% every single day, at the end of the year, you would have $3,778.34\n\n= $100 * (1 + 1%) ^ 365. That is 37.78x what you had at the beginning of the year. Get that 1% every single day!\n\nPPS: Yes, I am a math geek. No, I wasn’t cool enough to join the football team, so I joined the math team. Thanks for putting up with me.\n\nCreate Fun and a Little Weirdness\n\nOne of the things that makes Zappos different from a lot of other companies is that we value being fun and being a little weird. We don’t want to become one of those big companies that feel corporate and boring. We want to be able to laugh at ourselves. We look for both fun and humor in our daily work.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nIn reality, there is a bit of truth in each of these arguments; however, this piece of truth does not negate the fact that these are all excuses even we refuse to fully accept. It is time to stop staring. My favorite line is “no one ever erected a statue in honor of a committee.” Individuals with courage and conviction make the majority that drives change. This is a choice you must make. No one can make it for you. Either you will embrace the chal- lenge or you will leave it to others. The last thing you want to see happen is one of your peers deciding to be that majority of one who will drive this\n\nc12.qxd(183-192) 12/8/04 11:58 AM Page 186\n\n186\n\nTHE ULTIMATE CHOICE: CUSTOMER STRATEGIES\n\nchange and reap the rewards. Stop staring. Start acting. You know it is the right thing to do. You know it will make the right impact on the company. You know it is something you will enjoy doing. It comes from a place where you are very passionate. Stop staring at your own passion. Make it happen.\n\nCOMPLETE VIEW OF A SUCCESSFUL CUSTOMER STRATEGY\n\nTo succeed in making it happen, you must start with a clear vision in mind. You should be able to see the smiling, surprised faces of your customers as they experience your newly designed experiences. You must envision a clear segmentation process that focuses on the right customers, while neglecting the ones that are not suitable for you.\n\nYou also must define a clear financial justification for the efforts. Change is not free. It will require investment to change processes, educate people, and acquire the tools. You ought to know and document why you are putting forth all these efforts. As detailed before, there are many financial drivers that justify customer strategies, so you should create a customized plan and be ready to measure and execute it. If you execute it well, you are most likely to exceed expectations and see customers showering you with loyalty and new business.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nCautionary note: Some haters just hate, and that’s it. But even if you assume their grievances are not justified, read their reviews and determine as objectively as you can if there’s something there you can learn from. Although you may not always like what’s being said, you must set up social monitoring so you always know what is being said about your company, product, service, and brand.\n\n7. Make It Easy and Fun to Understand: As a corporate strategist, I have watched the strategic process of rolling out road- maps for decades. Somewhere along the way, it became essential that companies have a formal process that everyone is supposed to follow. Hogwash! It’s true that how you lay out your roadmap makes a difference, so make it visual—for example, use icons— 240\n\nsince that is the best way to communicate ideas and steps. Histor- ically, roadmaps have looked like business plans—dry, boring, and hard to understand. Instead, build your roadmap graphically, make it fun, and make it colorful.\n\nYour roadmap format should be as simple as possible, making maximum use of icons and graphics. If you want to make your roadmap matter, you need to communicate your goals from the janitor all the way up to the executive suite. Everyone needs to understand your mission, goals, strategic pillars, strategies, and measurements. That way, they will be able to participate fully.\n\nRecently, I’ve noticed that organizations are creating info- graphics that act as strategic snapshots for their roadmaps. They are easy to understand and are actually fun to look at. In my business, we build roadmaps as graphically thoughtful Power- Point decks that usually include ten to fifteen slides. It’s not a bunch of corporate speak; it’s language everybody can relate to. The format reflects what we stand for, and this is how we are going to achieve it.\n\nThe best organizations are careful to bring in baby boomers, GenXers, and millennials to make sure their plan’s language reso- nates across generations. In creating your roadmap, there are a few things that it’s important you don’t do:\n\nDon’t use corporate speak when creating your plan.\n\nDon’t make it about profit and sales. Make it about an en-\n</source>\n",
