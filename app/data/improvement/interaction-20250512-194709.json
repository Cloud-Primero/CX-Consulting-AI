As you've read in this book already, the chances that you can be success ful just selling the \"thing\" (the product) is slim to none; you need to sell the experience, the dream, your one-of-a-kind expertise and so forth. We aren't selling money in our business; we're selling the smart fulfillment of an aspira tional dream.\n\nHere is an example of our carefully crafted office tour when someone local comes to visit. Much like a Broadway play, the performance occurs in exactly the same way each time:\n\nStep 1. Receptionist greets the person with, \"Welcome to Mercantile! My name is Ken. Who are you here to see?\" He knows they wouldn't be here if they weren't here to see someone in particular. \"Please have a seat while I personally tell them you're here.\" Step 2. The receptionist directs them to be seated in the plush office chair against the east wall to face our large Inc. 500 wall plaque and flatscreen television that is continuously playing a long, full-color slide show of properties we've financed with a bullet point slide listing the benefits of working with us that appears after every three slides shown. This conveys our credibility while demonstrating social proof. They \"cook\" there for up to five minutes with nothing else to look at or read, other than the things we want them to see. Step 3. Before le.aving to go find the person being met with, the recep tionist points to our revolving, vertical newsmagazine stand that's stocked with some of our past issues and encourages the prospective Client to browse through them and feel free to take them home to keep and/or share.

Address the most technically challenging tasks as soon as possible.\n\n2. Deliver a useful result as soon as possible.\n\nWe will focus on the first of these, since the second is addressed via early user feedback and MVP development. Just as a tracer bullet gives an idea of the target area, the term in software engineering involves trying different approaches to challenging ideas as soon as possible, trying to figure out which one “might” work.\n\nWhile prototypes are often just mocks that imitate functionality, a tracer bullet is “fired” to, for example, check the range of certain Bluetooth technologies very early in an IoT project. It contains code that might run in the final product. A tracer bullet is the engineers’ version of a wireframe that is tested with users. It gives an idea of what might work and what doesn’t – no more, but no less.\n\nTechnical hygiene factors\n\nRapid development, short iteration cycles, and the immediate application of changes pose huge challenges for the technical foundation of a project. When you apply a test-driven development approach to a very early (and still likely to change) prototype of an idea, you are facing a trade-off between maintainability and the risk of wasting time and money.\n\nWhat can you – as a service designer – learn from these approaches? How do you do service design reviews? How do you keep track of changes in your designs? Have you set up or automated essential tasks to be able to prototype more quickly and collect feedback faster?\n\nIt is hard to go into detail here, since the technical hygiene factors differ from one programming language to another and are specific to your technology stack. There are, however, four technical factors that every project of any status should have implemented:\n\n→ Code versioning\n\n→ Code reviews\n\n→ Build automation\n\n→ Documentation (even if it is hard to do)\n\nThese are the minimum standards to incorporate in any project involving software, even at a very early stage.\n\nIn later stages of a project, those technical standards need to be elevated to a higher level and may include the following:\n\n→ Style guides\n\n→ Dependency management\n\n→ Test-driven approach\n\n→ Log, error, and performance monitoring\n\n→ …\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nThere is no definitive list of factors to implement at a particular stage. Just be aware of them and make conscious decisions on whether you want to implement certain standards.\n\nImplementation\n\nThis section describes a typical lifecycle in a software project. It works both for an early-stage idea that is being tested for the first time and for the continuous improvement of a product. We will discuss implementation- specific concerns for software projects.\n\nPreparation\n\nBefore starting a new iteration, you must define the scope. A good way to frame it is to define a user job; for example, “When I drive from my hometown to work, I want to be automatically notified about any traffic jams so that I can get to the office on time.” Rather than focusing on specific target groups, the idea of user jobs is that anybody could be in that situation at some point. It moves away from the classic concept of user stories that define scope by focusing on a specific target group that wants something (“As a millennial I want notifications about all social media channels so I can stay up to date”) and focuses more on the context itself, instead targeting particular situations that all users might experience. It’s a foundation and usually the job will change, or new jobs will be added. At this stage, it is a starting point. 13\n\nFigure 8-4. THE PROCESS Structured questions help you fill the backlog in a reasonable way.\n\nFigure 8-5. Surviving in the agile world: Short daily stand-ups with the development team help align the process, checking the status of individual tasks against the overall roadmap.\n\nWhile traditional sprints in software engineering are timeboxed and take two or four weeks, the activities introduced here can have different lengths. The time needed for research, for example, depends on the complexity of the research question being tested. On the other hand, ideation is something that is usually done within a day.\n\nIf you aim to integrate service design into software engineering long term, it’s best to divide parts of the processes into team activities and individual activities. Workshops are an exhausting activity not just for the facilitator, but specifically for developers. Carefully separate activities like prototyping into team activities (mini-hackathons) and individual tasks (tracer bullet development) and give each team member time to work on their own before jumping back to team activities.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nNow divide the team into several groups of two to four people. Give each team the chance to discuss the results and their views on them. Next, generate as many ideas as possible using whatever method you prefer. A round of 10 plus 10 14 works well and is a good combination of individual work and team effort.\n\nAt the end of the first ideation step, each team should come up with one idea to continue with. Depending on their knowledge about service design, a next step could be a journey map, a first paper prototype, or anything that illustrates the idea and makes it testable. Each team should aim for a sh!tty first draft. 15 Ideally, they will have the chance to test their first prototype with one of the other teams to see if it solves the problem.\n\nAt the end of this activity you will have gone through ideation, prototyping, and some research. Usually in software teams, these workshops are held on a monthly basis, depending on the status of the research activities.\n\nSoftware prototyping Prototypes are there to be tested. 16 Depending on the technical dependencies, prototyping activities are all about either tracer bullet development (to figure out which approach might technically work) or gathering early user feedback and data. So at the end of this iteration there should be a working digital prototype that can be tested with real users. The next step can be another set of research and ideation activities, or if the feedback is positive: implementation.\n\nDepending on the complexity, this prototype can be the actual implementation or a rough sketch of an algorithm that is intended to solve a complex problem without touching edge cases of any kind. From a graphical point of view we can differentiate between low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes and high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes. Aim for lo-fi at first and add more details during the actual implementation.\n\nFigure 8-6. MANAGING COMPLEXITY Tracer bullet development is invaluable to get a first glimpse of technical feasibility in complex projects. One or two developers explore potential solutions for the most challenging problems. The result is not “production-ready” code but a better understanding of the problem. It is actually a form of prototyping; even if it fails it produces valuable results.\n\nBuild and implement\n\nIt is essential to have a solid framework for your research, ideation, and\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nA minimum viable product (MVP) in software development is a piece of software that contains just enough features to be deployed and tested by real users. 9 The idea is to boil down a product to the core problem that it solves and aim to find a minimum solution to the problem. It should be just useful enough to find out if the assumptions about the product idea are true, and how to improve it. Defining an MVP usually requires a lot of discussion. What can help is to define the job that the user actually has to do (job to be done) as the job story, 10 derive the MVP from that definition, then validate the need with potential users. Work on a solution and create a sh!tty first draft. Ask again. Iterate on it. And accept that your assumptions will change.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you should still apply at least some basic technical hygiene factors when it comes to building a software prototype. The boundaries between throwaway code and actual production code can be blurry. If a tracer bullet development turns out to be a huge success, if you are not careful you might end up with temporary code runnning in production.\n\nEarly user feedback\n\nFor early user feedback you don’t actually need an MVP. User feedback starts long before you have a digital product at hand. It can be a cardboard\n\nprototype, a desktop walkthrough, a paper prototype, a click dummy, or anything else that is detailed enough to ask potential customers what they think about it. Make early feedback a habit and aim for testable products after every iteration. 11 Again, this is not something that only product managers should do; designers, engineers, and team members from other disciplines should be involved as well. Create teams of two or three people from different disciplines and give them a task – for instance, to collect feedback on feature X, or test assumptions on prototype Y. Then ask them to present their research results to the rest of the team. This is an ideal foundation for ideation and again prototyping.\n\nTracer bullet development\n\nLet’s face it: some service innovations lead to technically challenging solutions. In order to tackle those big problems early on (and make sure they are solvable), it’s best to follow the tracer bullet approach, initially published by Andy Hunt and David Thomas. 12 In their book, they propose that tracer bullet development is comprised of two components:\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nThe information we sought included the stages of the journey, actions, thoughts or expectations, feelings, people, services, and locations relevant to the stages. We also wanted to identify the high points and low points of each stage. To simplify data collection, we created large butcher paper templates (one for each stage) for the data we needed.\n\nJourney map visualization\n\nAfter the workshop, we synthesized the data both editorially and visually. We transferred the data into a spreadsheet, grouped like items, and applied an\n\neditorial lens to the information. We did this to focus the information and make it succinct and digestible.\n\nIn the workshop, we used custom worksheets to capture the essence of what needed to be communicated to aid the editorial process.\n\n1. A rough-draft sketch of the customer journey helped us better understand the experience of a young person engaged in mental health programs.\n\n2. Journey sketches showed the different layers of the story.\n\n3. The Mo’ MAGIC journey map illustrates the complete journey with roadblocks that youths face on the path to empowerment.\n\n4. The ideation session generated 140 new, broadly defined concepts that were then prioritized.\n\n5. We gathered all the data points of the customer journey and analyzed them to tell a complete story.\n\nOur visual design process started on paper to quickly explore ideas. We then moved to Illustrator and continued exploring visual constructs. Once the visual matched the story we wanted to tell, we layered in the content. Several rounds of internal critique and share-outs with our stakeholders for feedback followed.\n\nApplying an editorial lens to the content of a journey map is a skill and art in itself.\n\nThe keys to a successful journey map include:\n\n1. Gathering the right content (then editing that for clarity, conciseness, and priority)\n\n2. Articulating a point of view through communication design\n\n3. Establishing an effective information hierarchy to ensure key messages are communicated and readers can access information at different levels of zoom\n\nIn other words, follow the core principles of effective communication design.\n\nJourney map outcome\n\nThe journey is broken into five stages, or phases. Each phase is signified by a one-word title: Unawareness, Sensing, Awareness, Connection, and\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nrapid changeover, 192 rapid iteration, 263-264 rapid prototyping, 192 rate ofcompounding, 211 rational fears, 259-260 reality distortion field, 112 Rekkit, 104 repeat purchase oruse, 208 required reading, 286-287 Robinson, Frank, 294n2 root cause analysis, 191,\n\n234-235\n\nRosso, Manuel, 99-102 RunningLean (Maurya), 288\n\nsabotage, 260, 263 Sanderson, Steve, 100-101 scale, challenges of, 264-265 scarce but secure resources, 254 School ofOne, 195-196, 297n5 scientific management, 272,\n\n277-278, 279\n\nscientific method, 55, 56-57,\n\n149-150,269\n\nScullin, Matthew, 202-204 service businesses, 227-228\n\nSGWDesignworks, 193-194 Shingo, Shigeo, 18, 186 shortcuts paradox, 228 shusa (chiefengineer), 256 Sienna minivan, 86-87 The Sims, 108 single-piece flow, 184-185, 200,\n\n296n2 Six Sigma, 107 Sloan, Alfred, 115 small batchproduction,\n\n184-187\n\nSMED (Single-Minute Exchange\n\nofDie), 186-187\n\nSmith, Brad, 33, 35 Smith, Jack, 212-213 smoke tests, 95, 118 SnapTax, 29-31 social learning classroom model,\n\n130-131\n\nsocial lobbyingplatform, 155 social networking, 150-160 social networks, 212-214 software craftsmanship movement, 107 SonyWalkman, 83-84 Southern Living, 213 Southwest, 177 speed regulation, 227-229, 233 split-test experiments, 136-138,\n\n151-152\n\nsplit-the-difference approach,\n\n225-226\n\nsprints, 132 stage-gate developmentmodel,\n\n112 Starbucks, 177 startup defined,27-29\n\nStartup Lessons Learned(blog), 7,\n\n285\n\nStartupLessons Learned conference, 286\n\nStartup MarketingBlog(Ellis),\n\n287\n\n\"StartupMetrics forPirates\"\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_10\" name=\"doc_10\">\nA typical CEM programme here involves delivering NPS scores to each and every call centre agent with associated verbatim, a programme essentially of efficiency and reducing any points of conflict rather than adding value to the customer’s engagement. This is employee engage- ment by numbers not by inspiration, empowerment or artisanship and one that only leads to siloed behaviour: I’m concerned about my NPS number not yours. As well as restricting behaviour: I must treat each customer in a fixed way.\n\nSo where in all this are you ‘throwing the Pike Place fish’? Think about it this way: if we go back to Pike Place and now apply this efficiency only, or as we saw ‘little e’ approach, what would we have found?\n\nCertainly there would be no focus on attracting customers through memorable moments. Instead there would have been a large-scale invest- ment in NPS (or other) software to measure every touchpoint with fish- mongers incentivised on their ability to get customers to score 9s or 10s. Of course, journey maps would have been invested in, bosses would have got their bonuses but taking cost out would have been the name of the game not adding value. The emphasis would have been on greater firm efficiency, as if measuring a boring experience is actually going to leap you into profit. Or a piece of machine data with attached PowerPoint slide pack that promises some algorithmic relationship to customer per- ception improvements is actually equivalent to what really goes on.\n\n12 Customer Experience Bad\n\nSo any frills and fancies around making the experience entertaining would have been removed. Pike Place would have spent money on sys- tems that would have pushed out junk mail to the inboxes of customers. Without a shadow of a doubt, the best fishmongers would have left and there would have been no focus on ‘throw the fish’; hell, what’s the ROI of that! Pike Place would have gone bust.\n</source>\n",
