  "response": "\n\nOkay, let's analyze those insights and formulate a plan.\n\n**Summary of Insights:**\n\n*   **Strong Promoter Base:** 58% of customers are promoters, indicating a generally positive brand perception. **(Source: doc_1)**\n*   **Checkout Friction:** \"Checkout too slow\" is a recurring theme, suggesting a significant pain point impacting the customer journey. **(Source: doc_9)**\n*   **Positive Design & Support:** Customers appreciate the product design and find support helpful, highlighting strengths to leverage. **(Source: doc_3)**\n\n**Proposed Actions to Boost NPS by 5 Points Next Quarter:**\n\n1.  **Optimize Checkout Process:** Implement a streamlined checkout process. This could involve reducing the number of steps, offering guest checkout options, or optimizing payment gateway integration. Addressing this directly tackles a key customer frustration. **(Source: doc_9)**\n2.  **Highlight Product Design in Marketing:**  Leverage the positive feedback about product design in marketing materials and campaigns. Showcase the design's benefits and appeal to attract new customers and reinforce the value proposition for existing ones. **(Source: doc_3)**\n3.  **Proactive Support Outreach:**  Expand proactive support initiatives. This could include offering tutorials, FAQs, or personalized assistance based on customer behavior. Building on the existing positive perception of support can further solidify loyalty. **(Source: doc_4)**\n\nThese actions focus on addressing the identified pain points while reinforcing existing strengths. To accurately measure the impact of these changes, it's important to continue tracking NPS and verbatim feedback.",

The NPS is then calculated by subtracting the percentage of “detractors,” who rate the likelihood anywhere from 1 to 6, from the percent- age of “promoters,” who rate it 9 or 10. With research from Bain and Satmetrix, Reichheld claims that the resulting metric is positively correlated not only with customer loyalty but with a company’s growth prospects and its general fi nan- cial performance. Reichheld also argues strongly that if a customer is willing to refer another customer, then he must be relatively more satisfi ed (and therefore more likely to remain loyal and valuable) himself as well. b As a very simple number based on a single question, NPS doesn’t offer a lot of diagnostic ben- efi t—that is, by itself, it isn’t likely to say much about why a customer is or is not willing to recommend, but it has to be admired for its simplicity and practicality as well as its intuitive logic. More recently, NPS has been expanded by its adopt- ers to a transformative system for businesses rather than just a metric. c\n\nSignifi cantly, calculating NPS requires subtracting detractors from promot- ers, which is an excellent idea, because customer dissatisfaction has been found to be a much better predictor of defection than customer satisfaction is of loy- alty. Despite this fact, most companies that do track their customer satisfaction scores don’t bother trying to track dissatisfaction scores. This is a big mistake, because when customers talk about a company with other customers, it isn’t always positive. And negative word of mouth can be an insidious, destructive force all by itself, with a real effect on the fi nancial value of the fi rm.

By taking the percentage of the scores between detractors and sub- tracting that from the percentage of promoters you derive the Net Promoter Score or NPS.\n\nNet Promoter Score\n\n=\n\n% Promoters\n\n–\n\n% Detractors\n\nThe supporting research showed a strong correlation between pro- pensity to recommend and future loyalty and impact on business performance over time. This measure now appears on senior man- agers’ and executives’ key performance indicators and personal KPIs with a note writ large to ‘improve this score at all costs’.\n\nThe question for you if you are deploying this measure and the business has a strategy to improve the direction of travel of that score is: ‘How do we operationalise this in order to effect the required improvement?’\n\nIn short the answer is to ask the qualitative free text supplementary question ‘why did you give this score?’ to give context and a quan- titative overlay. This information provides the context for the cus- tomer response and reveals to you what to do more of, what you are doing well, and what to change – namely what you are doing badly. You then monitor the trend of your results over time.\n\nRemember in Net Promoter it is more about the delta or direction of travel of your results than the actual number. That way you avoid issues of cultural bias, among others\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\n40 Bruce D. Weinberg and Paul D. Berger, “Connected Lifetime Value: The Impact of Social Media,” Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice 12 (2011): 328–344. 41 Net Promoter Score (NPS), developed by Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Co., and Fred Reichheld, is a popular measure of the difference between customer satisfaction and dis- satisfaction based on a customer’s willingness to recommend a product, company, or brand. 42 You can also learn a lot from “Prepaid Cards: Second-Tier Bank Account Substitutes,” a Consumers Union report by staff attorney Michelle Jun, September 2010, available at http:// www.defendyourdollars.org/Prepaid%20WP.pdf, accessed June 14, 2011. 43 We found fascinating the CFO survey that found 78 percent of executives would sacrifice “economic value” to make this quarter’s numbers: Emery P. Dalesio, “Executives Sacrifice Shareholder Value to Please Street,” Associated Press State & Local Wire, February 9, 2004. “Three-quarters of business executives admit they massage earnings reports to meet or beat Wall Street expectations and would sacrifice shareholder value to keep earnings on a smooth upward slope, according to a survey released Monday. The study of 401 senior financial execu- tives by researchers at Duke University and the University of Washington found that 55 percent would delay starting a project to avoid missing an earnings target. Four out of five executives said they would defer maintenance and research spending to meet earnings targets. The pref- erence for smooth earnings growth instead of even slight variations is so strong that 78 percent of the surveyed executives would give up economic value in exchange, the study said.”\n\nChapter 11: Optimizing around the Customer: Measuring the Success of Customer-Based Initiatives\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nSales Velocity. How quickly after the experience did the prospect purchase? Getting people to buy is great. Getting them to buy more quickly generates exponentially more revenue for your company. • Speed to Action. Did the participant take one or more actions: down- loaded information; shared your content online; visited your website? More importantly, can you connect those initial actions to later pur- chases?\n\nNet Promoter Score. Net Promoter Scores are calculated using the answer to a single question: How likely is it that you would recom- mend [brand name] to a friend or colleague? Respondents are grouped along a 10‐point scale based on their answers: ⚪ Promoters (score 9 to 10). Loyal enthusiasts who will continue to buy and will refer others, creating growth.\n\n140 Experiential Marketing\n\n⚪ Passives (score 7 to 8). Satisfied but not enthusiastic customers who\n\ncan be enticed to switch brands.\n\n⚪ Detractors (score 0 to 6). Unhappy customers who can damage your\n\nbrand and stifle growth through negative word‐of‐mouth.\n\nTo determine your Net Promoter Score, subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. Your score can range from a low of –100 (if every customer is a Detractor) to a high of +100 (if every customer is a Promoter). Net Promoter was introduced by Fred Reichheld in a 2004 Harvard Business Review article, based on research done with Satmetrix. The research identified a link between higher Net Promoter Scores and business growth.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nanswer\tseveral\tof\tthe\tmost\tcommon\tquestions,\tincluding\t“Why\tis\tNet\tPromoter so\tpopular?”\tand\t“Is\tthe\tNet\tPromoter\tScore\t(NPS)\ta\tgood\tcustomer\texperience metric?”\tSee\tthe\tNovember\t21,\t2011,\tForrester\tReport,\t“Executive\tQ&A:\tNet Promoter\tFor\tCustomer\tExperience\tProfessionals,”\tavailable\tat http://forr.com/outin8-6. 7\tForrester\tanalyzed\tthe\tcorrelation\tbetween\thow\tconsumers\trated\ttheir experience\twith\tcompanies\ton\tour\tCustomer\tExperience\tIndex\tand\ttheir\tanswer to\tthe\tNPS\tquestion\tfor\ttwo\tindustries:\tbanks\tand\tretailers.\tThe\tcorrelation coefficient\tfor\tCXi\tand\tNPS\tfor\tbanks\twas\t0.679,\tand\tfor\tretailers,\tit\twas\t0.618.
