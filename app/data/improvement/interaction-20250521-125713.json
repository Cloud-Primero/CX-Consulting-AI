  "question": "tell me abour ROI analysis and stuff ; the frameworks and best way to make documents",
  "response": "\n\nROI analysis, particularly in the context of customer experience (CX), is about demonstrating the financial value of CX investments. Here's a breakdown of frameworks and best practices for creating compelling ROI documents:\n\n**1. Frameworks for ROI Analysis**\n\n*   **The \"Good to Great\" Framework:** While not directly about ROI, this framework emphasizes building a culture of discipline and focusing on the intersection of what you're good at, what customers value, and what you can be the best at. This foundational alignment is crucial for successful CX investments **(Source: doc_6)**.\n*   **Strategy Canvas:** This framework, described in \"Charting Your Company’s Future,\" suggests moving away from lengthy, data-muddled strategic documents and instead creating a visual \"strategy canvas\" to communicate and engage stakeholders **(Source: doc_2)**. This applies to ROI documents as well – clarity and visual communication are key.\n*   **Touchpoint Inventory & Diagram:** Creating a visual map of the customer journey, including touchpoints, helps identify areas for CX improvement and allows you to quantify the impact of changes **(Source: doc_7)**.\n*   **Three Types of Need:** Understanding the functional, personal engagement, and working customer needs helps tailor CX investments for maximum impact and ROI **(Source: doc_5)**.\n\n**2. Best Practices for ROI Documents**\n\n*   **Focus on Clarity and Visuals:** Avoid overwhelming stakeholders with data. Use visuals like strategy canvases and journey maps to communicate the story of CX investment and its expected return **(Source: doc_2, doc_7)**.\n*   **Iterative Process:**  Content creation is an iterative process, requiring continuous testing and learning to ensure optimal results **(Source: doc_4)**.\n*   **Start with a Draft:** Assemble a small group of stakeholders to create a draft model of the experience together, focusing on agreement on the underlying model rather than data analysis **(Source: doc_7)**.\n*   **Link CX to Performance:**  Initiating CX strategy changes by linking them to performance and using CX measurement is a proven way to ensure management **(Source: doc_3)**.\n*   **Small Changes, Big Impact:**  Focus on identifying and making small changes in your processes, as these \"little hinges\" can open up big doors to improved results **(Source: doc_10)**.\n\n**3. Key Considerations**\n\n*   **Data-Driven:** While visuals are important, ROI analysis requires solid data to support your claims.\n*   **Relationship-Focused:** Remember that relationships are more complex than transactions, and loyalty rewards are only a small part of the equation. Focus on building strong relationships through personalized experiences **(Source: doc_5)**.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps! Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points?",
  "context": "<source id=\"doc_1\" name=\"doc_1\">\nI've tried to come up with a simple way to convey what was required to go from all the data, analyses, debates, and \"dogs that did not bark to the final findings in this book. The best answer I can give is that it was an itgr- a$ve Drocess of looping back and forth, developing ideas and testing them seeingitircak against the - data, revising the -- ideas, building under the weight of evidence, and rebuilding it;yet_agin. That process was repeated over and over, until everything hung together in a coherent framework of concepts. We all have a strength or two in life, and I suppose mine is the ability to take a lump of unorganized information, see pat- terns, and extract order from the mess-to &r-chaos\n\n---. a framework, -v --\n\nto concept.\n\nThat said, however, I wish to underscore again that the concepts in the final framework are not my \"opinions.\" While I cannot extract my own\n\n11\n\n12\n\nlim Collins\n\npsychology and biases entirely from the research, each finding in the final framework met a rigorous standard before the research team would deem it significant. Every primary concept in the final framework showed up as a change variable in 100 percent of the good-to-great companies and in less than 30 percent of the comparison companies during the pivotal years. Any insight that failed this test did not make it into the book as a chapter-level concept.\n\nHere, then, is an overview of the framework of concepts and a preview of what's to come in the rest of the book. (See the diagram below.) Think of the transformation as a process of buildup followed by breakthrough, broken into three broad stages: d m k e d people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action. Within each of these three stages, there are two key concepts, shown in the framework and described below. Wrapping around this entire framework is a concept we came to call the flywheel, which captures the gestalt of the entire process of going from good to great.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nplannable business. If a new idea passes its evaluation by the tools introduced here, and if it is fairly communicated to stakeholders, managers can be confi dent that they have found a winner. But our framework does more than just evaluate individual new ideas. By revealing what makes a new idea a commercial success, it enables companies to develop a coherent strategy for becoming successful at business innovation. To put it another way, the tools help companies not only to recognize a winner when they see one but also to know where to start looking in the fi rst place.\n\nOriginally published in September–October 2000. Reprint R00510\n\n92\n\nCharting Your Company’s Future\n\nJ\n\nJ OHN R EED OF C ITICORP was known for insisting that his executives get the big picture. As chairman and CEO, he demanded that busi- ness unit heads present their proposed strategies in no more than a few slides. Executives who failed to meet Reed’s exacting standards for brevity met with his unconcealed displeasure. And if it happened too often, they ran the risk of being left out of the loop on future strategy sessions.\n\nMany leaders share Reed’s obsession with the big picture, yet our research shows that few companies actually have a clear strategic vision. The problem, we believe, stems from the strategic-planning process itself. The process usually involves the preparation of a large document—culled from a mishmash of data provided by people from various parts of the organization who often have confl icting agendas and poor communication. The report typically begins with a lengthy description of the industry and the competitive situation. There follows a discussion of how to increase market share here and there, capture new segments, or cut costs, which leads to an outline of numerous goals and initiatives. A full budget is almost invariably attached, as are lavish graphs and a surfeit of spreadsheets.\n\nNo wonder so few strategic plans turn into action; executives are paralyzed by the muddle. But it doesn’t have to be that way. We suggest an alternative approach to strategic planning, based not on preparing a document but on drawing a picture we call a “strategy canvas.” This approach consistently produces strategies that are easy to understand and communicate, that engage more people within\n\n93 93\n\nKIM AND MAUBORGNE\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\n4. What is the best way to initiate or change a company’s CX strategy? There isn’t really a best way, because the circumstances will differ from firm to firm. One proven way to initiate these changes is by linking CX strategy to performance, and using a CX measurement such as EXQ is a verified way to do this. After all, only what gets measured gets managed.\n\nOn a personal note, please allow me to express my gratitude and say thank you for taking the time to read my book, I hope you had a good experience and found some answers to the questions that were on your mind. I hope that by now you com- prehend that I am rather passionate about customer experience and the challenges it brings to firms, managers, consultants, and researchers. I believe it is my duty, and pleasure to explore CX, CX strategies, and CX management in order to share the knowledge we create with everyone who is interested. This passion and my thirst for knowledge drive my research and my ambitions to deliver information that you can use to make your firm a better performing one using CX – after all, successful CX is based upon delivering great experiences. Thus, if we all get the experiences we are looking for, we are happy – at least that’s what I believe. And what more can one wish for than being (partially) responsi- ble for another person’s happiness?\n\nBeing well aware that the post-purchase experience is crucial in influencing both your experience and your assessment of it, I want to provide you with some free additional resources that you might find useful (please see page xxx for details).\n\n117\n\n118\n\nMeasuring Customer Experience\n\nI believe that we all learn something new every single day, and I would love you to share your invaluable insight and feedback on my book and our research with me.\n\nPlease contact me at profdrphilklaus@gmail.com.\n\nYour consideration is highly appreciated and I am looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nProf. Dr. Phil Klaus\n\nFree resources aka SWAG\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nThe\tmagic\tmay\tbe\tin\tthe\tvisual\tmix,\tbut\tthere\tis\tno\tset\tformula\tfor\tthe\tright blend\tof\tcontent.\tIn\tfact,\tit’s\tquite\tthe\topposite.\tAs\twe\tcovered\tin\tthe\tStrategy Laws,\tit’s\timportant\tto\tbuild\ta\tstrategic\tframework\tthat\tallows\tyou\tto continue\tto\ttest\tand\tlearn\tto\tensure\tthat\tyou\tare\tgenerating\tthe\tbest\tresults.\n\nThe\talways-on\tnature\tof\tdigital\tand\tsocial\tmedia\tchannels,\tcoupled\twith ever-changing\tplatforms\tand\talgorithms,\thas\tcreated\tan\tenvironment\tin\twhich change\tis\tthe\tonly\tconstant.\tIn\torder\tto\tthrive\tin\tthis\tclimate,\tbusinesses\tneed to\tanalyze\tand\tmeasure\tthe\tperformance\tof\ttheir\tcontent\ton\ta\tregular\tbasis\tto determine\twhere\tto\tdouble\tdown\tand\toptimize\ta\twin\tor\tassess\tif\ta\tstrategic pivot\tis\tneeded.\tEach\tpiece\tof\tcontent\toffers\tan\topportunity\tto\tconnect\twith your\tcustomers,\tinfluencers,\tindustry\tpeers,\tand\teven\tthe\tnews\tmedia.\tAs\ta result,\tit’s\tcritical\tto\thave\tthat\tfeedback\tloop\tof\tsentiment,\ttop\tquestions,\tor criticisms\tin\tplace,\tallowing\tyou\tto\toptimize\tor\tpivot\tas\tneeded.\n\nTHE\tQUALITY\tLAW\n\nOne\tquestion\tmarketers\talways\task\tus\tabout\tcrafting\ttheir\tcontent\tis,\t“What\tif we\tdon’t\thave\tthe\tbudget\tfor\tan\tagency\tor\tfreelancers\tto\tdevelop\thigh-quality content?”\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nAt the end of the day customers are looking for simple products, services and brands. However, relationships are more complex because they are more durable. So loyalty rewards are only 15% of a relationship.\n\nThe essence of the relationship is I do stuff for you; you do stuff for me. AI can model this, hence we need tracking. Start with feedback, where the content is delivered at the right moment to the right person in the right way within the relationship context. Not 200 questions, but single ques- tions of relevance.\n\nThe quality movement want a single question but convenience does not mean relevance. We need more questions in the encounter. Collected in a smart way; in this way in all environments we can make the encounter richer.\n\nThree Types of Need\n\nThe functional need to achieve efficiency and effectiveness – I give you your room key.\n\nThe personal engagement – how are your kids doing The working customer – can you do me a favour and check-out at this time, due to the long queue: since there is more pleasure in giving than taking.\n\nIronically in loyalty there is the concept of the working customer, some- one who makes a contribution to the encounter. When customers make their own contribution they are more satisfied with you as an organisation. Hence, we need to make the connections stronger.\n\nThis goes beyond the value-in-use concept of Experience.\n\n13\n\nInterconnectedness\n\nGet Grounded\n\nWe also shouldn’t seek to over abstract things. Customers certainly don’t. Instead we should take a more grounded and down-to-earth view. Take the example of loyalty. Your neighbour would not understand you saying you are an ambassador for loyalty. They would just look at your invested behav- iours, how you ‘do something for them’. Hence, loyalty is a process an activity.\n\nCustomer Value Creation\n\nGoing forward then we must connect the notion of experience to cus- tomer value creation, which means we cannot focus only on the transac- tional or hygienic. These things just set the platform for the relationship. We must also go beyond SERVQUAL, beyond the belief that every- thing is about managing how customers calculate expectations against ratings of reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness. This is a limited approach to the phenomenology of experience where customers:\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nAbbott Laboratories exemplifies a key finding of our study: a culture of discipline. By its nature, \"culture\" is a somewhat unwieldy topic to discuss, less prone to clean frameworks like the three circles. The main points of this chapter, however, boil down to one central idea: Build a culture h l l of\n\n123\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI I\n\n11\n\n~ 1 I I I\n\nI\n\n124\n\nlim Collins\n\npeople who take disciplined action within the three circles, fanatically con- sistent with the Hedgehog Concept.\n\nMore precisely, this means the following:\n\n1. Build a culture around the idea of freedom and responsibility, within a\n\nframework.\n\n2. Fill that culture with self-disciplined people who are willing to go to extreme lengths to fulfill their responsibilities. They will \"rinse their cottage cheese.\"\n\n3. Don't confuse a culture of discipline with a tyrannical disciplinarian. 4. Adhere with great consistency to the Hedgehog Concept, exercising an almost religious focus on the intersection of the three circles. Equally important, create a \"stop doing list\" and systematically unplug anything extraneous.\n\nF R E E D O M ( A N D R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y )\n\nW I T H I N A F R A M E W O R K\n\nPicture an airline pilot. She settles into the cockpit, surrounded by dozens of complicated switches and sophisticated gauges, sitting atop a massive $84 million piece of machinery. As passengers thump and stuff their bags into overhead bins and flight attendants scurry about trying to get every- one settled in, she begins her preflight checklist. Step by methodical step, she systematically moves through every required item.\n\nCleared for departure, she begins working with air traffic control, fol- lowing precise instructions-which direction to take out of the gate, which way to taxi, which runway to use, which direction to take off. She doesn't throttle up and hurtle the jet into the air until she's cleared for takeoff. Once aloft, she communicates continually with flight-control centers and stays within the tight boundaries of the commercial air traffic system.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\na high level, consider some of the basics of creating a map\n\ndiscussed in Chapter 2: the point of view, scope, focus, and\n\nstructure.\n\nThe draft diagram will guide future research.

Remember, no single finding by itself makes a great organization; you need to have them all working together as an integrated set. Then work sequentially through the framework, starting with \"first who\" and moving through all the major components. Meanwhile, work continuously on your own development toward Level 5 leadership. I have laid out this book in a sequence consistent with what we observed in the companies; the very structure of the book is a road map. I wish you the best of luck on your journey from good to great.\n\nSELECTION PROCESS FOR GOOD-TO-GREAT COMPANIES\n\nResearch-team member Peter Van Genderen was instrumental in the cre- ation of the selection criteria and in the \"death march of financial analysis\" required to use the criteria to find the good-to-great companies.\n\nC r i t e r i a f o r S e l e c t i o n a s a G o o d - t o - G r e a t Company\n\n1. The company shows a pattern of \"good\" performance punctuated by a transition point, after which it shifts to \"great\" performance. We define \"great\" performance as a cumulative total stock return of at least 3 times the general market for the period from the point of transition through fif- teen years (T + 15). We define \"good\" performance as a cumulative total stock return no better than 1.25 times the general stock market for the fif- teen years prior to the point of transition. Additionally, the ratio of the cumulative stock return for the fifteen years after the point of transition divided by the ratio of the cumulative stock return for the fifteen years prior to the point of transition must exceed 3.\n\n2. The good-to-great performance pattern must be a company shift, not an industry event. In other words, the company must demonstrate the pattern not only relative to the market, but also relative to its industry.\n\n3. At the transition point, the company must have been an established, ongo- ing company, not a start-up. This was defined as having operations for at least twenty-five years prior to the transition point. Additionally, it had to have been publicly traded with stock return data available at least ten years prior to the transition point.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\n5.\t Reflect.\t You\t should\t now\t have\t a\t notepad\t full\t of\t reflections\t of\t which organizational\t methods\t were\t the\t most\t useful\t (functional)\t and\t the\t most\n\nmeaningful\t(emotional).\tSome\tmay\talso\thave\tsocial\tbenefits\tto\tyou\tand\tother members\tof\tyour\thousehold.\tYou\tcan\tnow\trecreate\tthe\torganizational\tmethod you\tfound\tmost\tuseful\ton\tyour\trefrigerator.\n\nOf\tcourse,\tin\tbusiness\tyou\tdon't\thave\tto\tlimit\tyourself\tto\tone\torganizational method.\tAs\twith\tother\tforms\tof\tdata,\tit\tcan\tbe\tvery\tuseful\tto\tslice\tand\tdice\tthe data,\t to\t organize\t and\t display\t the\t same\t data\t set\t in\t a\t variety\t of\t ways.\t Some organizing\tframeworks\twill\thelp\tyou\tmake\tdecisions,\tsome\twill\thelp\tyou\tshare what\tyou\thave\tlearned,\tsome\tare\thigh-level\tand\tabstract,\tand\tothers\tcan\tcapture more\tdetail.\tComing\tup\twith\tdifferent\tframeworks\tis\ta\tmessy,\titerative\tprocess.

Marketing Letter\" with a small metal hinge glued to the top of the first page. That was a visual that I will never forget and it really hit home with me. He wrote an entire issue abour how \"little hinges can open up big doors\" which illustrates the BIG LESSON of this chapter: identifying and making small changes in your sales processes can make a big change in your results.\n\nLet me give you five little hinges, tell you how I have applied them to my businesses, and at the end of each I'll provide you with a smart question for you to ask yourself abour each of them.\n\nLittle Hinge #1: Greetings One of the biggest struggles that retailers have is engaging prospects in con versation when they walk into their doors. Think about what normally hap pens when you walk into a retail store. The salesperson typically approaches you and opens up the conversation with the five words \"How Can I HeLp You?\" Most people are conditioned to respond with the five words that salespeo ple hate to hear: \"No Thanks) rm Just Looking.» This disengages the prospect in conversation; a salesperson can only do her job and maximize the opportunity to sell the prospect if there is a dialogue.\n\nSo, after years of doing it the way I just described, I made a little hinge change which was to change the script of the salesperson's greeting. Instead I say: \"HeLLo. What Brings You Into the Store Today?»\n\nThis might not sound like a big change, but it was. Now the prospect would give a much more lengthy response which would allow the salesperson to follow up the conversation, often with a follow-up question.\n</source>\n",
