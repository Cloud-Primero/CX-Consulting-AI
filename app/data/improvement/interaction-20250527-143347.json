You can’t scale an idea or expertise, but you can scale software. So, if we take the experience the customer has, then feed it through the mincer, TQMing it, breaking it down into components and in the process miss out on how cognition really works, we can measure and monitor it. And voila we have a prac- tice. This has the unfortunate effect of giving us false hope while at the same time failing to account for experience losses.\n\n4Customer experience has become a general term for: (1) service design, (2) seeing things through the customer’s eyes and (3) serving up any old thing as ‘selling experience’. Apart from the last item, this is not a bad thing. But it does mean it holds little difference in meaning from say service and customer research! Hence, service design should really be experience design. In addition, the complexity of digitalisation and multichannel inte- gration has meant that the words ‘customer experience’ are just useful terms with which to talk about user experience. This is all fine, but an over-brand is not enough, even if it does give a sense of mystique (not quite definable, slippery, can mean what you want, magical!). We need to consider the experience economy definition and how we can create an experience not manage one.\n\n5I am aware that relationship marketing is the origin here and that there is a clear ROI of CRM based on software. However, I stand by my comment: if you use a qualitative term like relationship then you need to demonstrate a qualitative benefit!\n\n6If you take a technology enabler to be ‘the customer experience’ you risk assuming that when the machine KPIs work well then the customer must be happy! This is not necessarily the case if the customer thinks of the ‘enablement’ as hygienic. And certainly not the case because no customer buys the tech enablement; they buy the benefit that’s derived. Likewise, where do you stop your technology enablement as an experi-\n\nence definition?\n\nA back-office document bill printer has a critical role to play in the experience of electricity and gas buying. Is this now a customer experi- ence solution?\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nthose\tposts.\tLet\tme\tping\tyou\tregarding\tyour\tTech\tSupport\tcall.\t[Note\tthat after\tthis\tmessage,\tPriscilla\tcontacted\tChris\tin\tprivate,\tusing\tthe\tmessaging function\tof\tSpiceworks.]\n\nChris\tthen\treplied:\n\nThanks\tfor\tall\tyour\thelp\tPriscilla.\tHP\tsupport\tcame\tthrough\twith\tthe\n\nmultibyte\tfile.\tMy\tprinter\thas\tbeen\tcured.\tThanks!\n\nAnd\tPriscilla\twrapped\tit\tup\tbeautifully:\n\nHello\tChris,\tthanks\tvery\tmuch\tfor\tthe\tpositive\tupdate.\tWonderful\tnews!\n\nYour\tupdate\thas\tmade\tmy\tafternoon.\tPlease\tlet\tme\tknow\twhenever\tyour products\tneed\t“curing.”\tEnjoy\tthe\tholiday\tbreak.5\n\nIt’s\tnot\tdifficult\tto\tprovide\tgreat\tsupport\tin\tforums.\tBut\tyou\tdo\tneed\tto devote\tknowledgeable\tpeople\tto\tit,\tand\tgive\tthem\tthe\topportunity\tto\tmake themselves\thuman\tand\tapproachable.\n\nHugging\tHaters\ton\tReview\tSites\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nUploaded by [StormRG]\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nmy friend and his wife have never been happier.\n\n209\n\nIN-TOUCH MOMENTS: PERSONAL, RELEVANT, AND VALUABLE\n\nThe bottom line for most consumers is that they don’t want com- panies contacting them unless they come bearing gifts. The best organizations stay in touch with their customers by offering real, valuable benefits that are not designed for the specific purpose of selling more products and services.\n\nIt’s okay to make money as a result of staying in touch with your customer, but if your principal goal is to make money, you’re going to fail miserably. Your in-touch offers should be exclusive and meaningful. For this reason, you must carefully manage the frequency of these offers. The purpose of staying in touch with customers is to maintain personal, relevant, and valuable contact. My kids have braces and our dentist sends them texts to re- mind them to brush their teeth or tell them which foods to avoid and so on in the name of healthy teeth and undamaged braces. It’s a way to stay in touch frequently and isn’t an attempt to sell us anything. The dentist is just helping my kids have a better experi- ence. In this way, the dentist is using connectivity to add value.\n\nIn addition to making in-touch offers and\n\ncommunications personal, relevance is extremely\n\nimportant. Office Depot knows that I own an HP printer. The company also knows the model. Using its Customer Relationship Management tools for good instead of evil, Office Depot can make me surgically precise offers for inkjet and laser cartridges it knows I need and ultimately want.\n\nThe best use of CRM tools is for providing infor-\n\nmation and opportunities that are exceedingly\n\n210\n\nTHE IN-TOUCHPOINT MOMENT\n\ngermane to your customer types. Respect me by not pushing out a bunch of stuff I don’t need. Instead, send me offers applicable to me, and you will have a customer for life.\n\nHOW TO DESIGN THE RIGHT IN-TOUCH MOMENTS\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_9\" name=\"doc_9\">\nWiley publishes in a variety of print and electronic formats and by print-on-demand.

I’ve clicked the gift delivery button and it’s given me some choices: Register as a Guest or Open an Account. They both have simple explanations under each of the boxes telling me what each one means. Signing up for an account sounds a little bit too involved and will take me longer. I’m going to sign up as a guest. So I’ll select ‘Send as a Guest’. I am expecting this to be really, really, quick and easy like it is on other sites where I have done this. The next screen is asking me for my name and then my email address and a password – it has a box next to it telling me why they need it and what they won’t do with it like selling my information, sending me loads of offers I don’t want, so I am relaxed about sharing my address. That is it, ‘job done’ and I have a simple but nice message ‘Hi Alan a very warm welcome to the MET Gift Store.
