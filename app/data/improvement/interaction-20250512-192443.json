  "question": "A VIP client emailed complaining that their order was delayed by 5 days and one item arrived damaged. Draft a warm, apologetic response that: 1. Acknowledges the delay and damage 2. Offers a replacement shipment with expedited delivery 3. Includes a small goodwill discount on their next order",
  "response": "\n\nSubject: Our Sincere Apologies Regarding Your Recent Order\n\nDear [VIP Client Name],\n\nPlease accept our sincerest apologies for the issues you experienced with your recent order. We understand the frustration of a 5-day delay and are truly sorry that one of the items arrived damaged. This is certainly not the standard of service we aim to provide, especially for our valued VIP clients **(Source: doc_4)**.\n\nWe're immediately arranging for a replacement shipment of all items, and we'll ensure it's expedited to reach you as quickly as possible. You can expect to receive it within [Shipping Timeframe] **(Source: doc_6)**.\n\nAs a token of our apology for the inconvenience, we'd like to offer you a [Discount Percentage]% discount on your next order. We value your business and appreciate your understanding.\n\nThank you for your continued loyalty. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name/Company Name]\n\n**Note:** *Please replace the bracketed information with the specific details.*",

So, for example, if the wait time for food exceeds 15 minutes, do we need to give the customer an update?\n\nThink about how it feels if you are expecting something to happen and it doesn’t. You could be waiting for a train or be a passenger when a flight is delayed on the runway. Receiving no information on the reason for the delay and the likely duration raises stress levels after only a few minutes – the benefit from updates even with limited information is it reduces the need for your imagination to fill the gap and to raise your stress levels. So do think about the impact of white space – is it fine to leave a customer applying for a loan several days without updating on the status?\n\nNow take each interaction in turn and ask the question: ‘is this a planned interaction or an unplanned interaction?’ For example, checking where my order is would be an unplanned interaction initiated by a customer concerned about wait time.\n\nYou now have a view of the interactions over time, the duration, planned and unplanned contact and can easily identify any dependencies across the timeline.\n\nFor instance, as we noted in the restaurant example, delivering food in a timely manner is connected to taking of the original order – do we wait for the customer to complain or deliberately design in an intervention in the case of delay?\n\nRemember that experiences can be over in minutes or extend over weeks before they are concluded\n\nAll of these stages provide the baseline map that can then be used to redesign existing experience, or design a new experience that better delivers the customer experience.\n\n105\n\nM06_PENN8465_01_SE_C06.indd 105\n\n21/07/16 3:04 pm\n\nTHE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BOOK\n\nShould we buy software – what do we need software to do?\n\nAs you will have now seen there are layers to the creation of cus- tomer journey maps – each stage takes the map to the next level of detail. Each version of the map can be created in basic tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Excel.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_2\" name=\"doc_2\">\nExperiment with timing. Measure the response rate to find out how long after the cart is abandoned to send the message. There are different schools of thought here. Some technology vendors recommend that you send a reminder as soon as possible. However, in our experience, faster is not always better. There are several reasons why you might want to wait a couple of hours, or preferably a full day, to send an abandoned cart campaign. First, some consumers find it creepy that you remind them right away. It strengthens the feeling that you are “watching every move of your customers.” That is exactly what most marketers are doing, but you may want to be a bit subtle about it. Second, if you have multi- ple channels it is very possible that some customers abandon a cart but subsequently buy the item using another channel, for example, your call center. Unless your call center software is synchronized in real time to the system that sends the abandoned cart reminders, you may want to wait a couple of hours. This is especially true if you decide to include a discount in your abandoned cart reminder. Nothing is more disappointing to a\n\nPlay Seven: Launch Predictive Programs to Convert More Customers\n\ncustomer than to realize they could have gotten a discount on the item they just purchased. Third, if you send a discount offer too quickly you may train your customers to expect a discount every time. If customers can get a discount just by placing an item in a cart and waiting for five minutes then every customer might do this going forward. That would have disastrous effects on your margins. Finally, some shoppers don’t appreciate to be bombarded with marketing messages. Whereas they might have bought from you that day, if you contact them one too many times, you might scare them away. As always, it is best to test what works in your situation.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_3\" name=\"doc_3\">\nonstage\thaters’\tplaybook.\tThis\tis\tbecause\tit\tis\taxiomatic.\tAs\twe\tdiscovered\tin chapter\t3,\tnearly\t40\tpercent\tof\tall\tsocial\tmedia\tcomplainers\twho\tanticipate\ta response\texpect\tit\tto\tarrive\twithin\tsixty\tminutes.\tYet\tthe\taverage\tlength\tof\ttime for\tbusinesses\tto\tactually\trespond\tis\tfive\thours.\tClosing\tthat\tgap\tis\tcritical,\tand should\tbe\ta\tfocus\tfor\tany\tlegitimate\tonline\tcustomer\tservice\tprogram.\n\nFind\tAll\tMentions\n\nIt’s\timpossible\tto\thug\tthe\thaters\tyou\tnever\tsee.\tIn\tthe\tlegacy,\toffstage\tchannels of\tphone\tand\ttelephone,\tthis\tisn’t\tan\tissue.\tIf\tsomeone\tcalls\tyour\tbusiness,\tyou know\tthey\tcalled.\tThe\tphone\twas\teither\tanswered\tor\tthe\tcaller\tleft\ta\tmessage.\t(If you\tdo\tnot\thave\tvoice\tmail\tat\tthis\tpoint,\tput\tdown\tthis\tbook\tand\tget\tthat\tsorted out.\tI’ll\twait\tfor\tyou.)\tThe\tsame\tis\ttrue\tfor\te-mail;\tthere’s\tno\tdetective\twork needed\tto\tfind\tthem,\tthey\tjust\tshow\tup\ton\tyour\tcomputer,\tphone,\tor\ttablet.\n\nBut\twith\tthe\tproliferation\tof\tonstage\tchannels,\tit’s\tentirely\tpossible—likely,\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_4\" name=\"doc_4\">\nThat\tpower\tcan\tsave\ta\tcustomer.\tSimilar\tto\tthe\timpact\tDave\tKerpen\thas\thad on\this\tone-star\treviewers,\tDebbie’s\thabit\tof\tsending\tgift\tcertificates\tto\tunhappy patrons\tcan\tcompletely\tchange\tthe\tattitude\tof\ta\tcustomer\twho\twould\totherwise defect.\t“We\tget\te-mails\tfrom\tpeople\tthat\tsay\tthings\tlike,\t‘Thank\tyou\tso\tmuch\tfor the\tgift\tcertificate\tyou\tsent.\tMy\tfood\twas\tlate\tand\tyou\tmade\tit\tup\tto\tme,\tand now\twe’re\tback,’”\tshe\tsays.\t“It\thappens\tall\tthe\ttime,\tand\twe\tknow\tit\tworks.” Chapters\t6\tand\t7\tinclude\tstep-by-step\tprocesses\tfor\thandling\thaters, organized\tby\tcomplaint\tchannel,\tbut\tregardless\tof\tcircumstance\tor\tcomplaint type,\tthe\tmost\timportant\telement\tin\tcustomer\trecovery\tis\tacknowledgment\tof\tthe mistake,\taccording\tto\tScott\tWise\tfrom\tScotty’s\tBrewhouse.\t“You\tcan\ttake\tsome of\tthe\tworst\tcomplaints\tand\tmost\tunpleasant\texperiences,\tand\tyou\tcan\tmake those\tpeople\tinto\tyour\tmost\traving\tfans\tif\tyou\thandle\tit\tproperly.\tAnd\tthat\tjust means\tacknowledging\tthem,\tacknowledging\tyou’ve\tmade\ta\tmistake,\tapologizing profusely,\tand\tmaking\tit\tright.”\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_5\" name=\"doc_5\">\nIf recommendations don’t work, send reminders with a simple “we miss you” and start to give your customers specific reasons to come back. For consumers, perhaps a discount will get them to buy again. For businesses, perhaps you offer up a free tune-up or training. The messaging and offers for inactive customers and lapsed customers are very similar, but you should increase the value of the offers as time goes on. It will become more and more difficult to convince customers to come back.\n\nYou should take into account the personalized repurchase window when doing this. Certain products have a longer time between two pur- chases, and certain customers have a longer time between purchases. No point to remind me every month to come back if you know from my past behavior that I am the type of shopper who comes just twice a year to stock up.\n\nLapsed Customer Strategies: We Miss You\n\nLapsed customers are those that haven’t bought for more than a year or those that let their subscription or service lapse. Here the guiding light is “what have we got to lose?” These customers may or may not respond to your emails, but there is a greater chance than with inactive customers that they are tuning out your communications. A strong offer is more important here than personalized recommendations and reminders.\n\nWhereas most of the strategies of reminders, escalating offers of help and reasons to come back, and simple “I miss you” still apply for this customer segment, you may need to try different channels to reach these customers. If a customer hasn’t opened an email from you for a year, it doesn’t help to continue to send emails. Instead, you may want to try direct mail or Facebook custom audiences advertising to reach these customers. Perhaps the customer will actually look at the postcard offer and be inspired to return to your store.\n\nPetCareRx sent postcards to reactivate lapsed customers. Postcards are expensive so they only sent these to customers with a relatively high likelihood to buy. Also, the incentive for coming back to PetCareRx was different for customers with different lifetime values. Those with higher lifetime values received a greater discount on their next order.\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nPlay Four: Predict Customer Value and Value-Based Marketing\n\nThe days of one-size-fits-all customer\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_6\" name=\"doc_6\">\nHere is how things actually played out. We called the top body shop in the area and explained what had happened. We asked if they could get the vehicle in and move it to the front of the line. We also got a commitment from them on a time frame as to when the vehicle would be repaired and returned back to us. Then we called a rental car agency in the area that we had a relationship with, found out the availability of a vehicle, and asked that it be delivered to our client at his office, and made sure they knew that we would be taking care of the bill. Another detail that we made sure to include when it came to the rental car was that we didn't want their cheap est, smallest car. This client normally drove a larger car and we didn't want to subject him to a small\" inexpensive vehicle for the few days that he was already going to be inconvenienced. This was no time or place to try and save a few dollars!\n\nI felt that it was important for Bob to call the customer for several rea sons; mainly so he could continue to learn, but also because this client was very comfortable dealing with Bob. I knew it was especially important that we get the language right. This was the script Bob used when he called the client at his office:\n\nHi Mr. Jones, this is Bob from Brookgate Tire & Auto Center. We had a little mishap here at the shop. Our lube technician was moving another client's vehicle and accidentally bumped into the rear of your car. We have made arrangements with the best body shop in the area to get your car in tomorrow and take care of the damage. They should have it finished in three days. We have also scheduled a [vehicle type] rental car to be delivered to you at your office this afternoon before it is time for you to leave. Of course we will be taking care of all of the expenses involved and I really apologize for any inconvenience that .this may cause you. Is this OK with you?\n\nYou may notice some of the changes in language Bob used that made a huge difference. Instead of referring to our employee as \"one of our guys\" we referred to him as our lube technician; we come across as more professional. He said another client's \"vehicle,\" instead of another customer's truck. A \"client\" infers more value than just a customer, and \"vehicle\" doesn't sound\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_7\" name=\"doc_7\">\nWhen reviewing complaints, we identified two types: solvable and unsolvable. The solvable complaints are easy. A customer calls and com- plains about an inaccurate bill. You should solve this request quickly on the first call, either by explaining the reason for the inaccuracy or by adjusting the bill to reflect the accurate situation. This should be done with full empow- erment to the employee to apologize and potentially provide a small com- pensation as an apology for the mistake. Make sure that your employees have the power to solve such complaints right away. Flatten the escalation process and shift power and education to the front-line employees who take the first call.\n\nUnsolvable complaints, however, represent a puzzling question. Why are people calling to submit their unsolvable complaints? Is it to let off steam? I would argue that they have done so already with their friends and family (as such, they spread bad reputation and increase the cost of new customers),\n\nc09.qxd(139-162) 12/8/04 11:57 AM Page 144\n\n144\n\nCRITICAL CHOICE 8: POST-SALES DIALOGUE AND SERVICE\n\nwho already patted their bruised egos and showered them with sincere pity. Why would these customers subject themselves to unnecessary hold time with lousy music and annoying messages, only to be talking to a faceless, uncaring employee?\n\nThe reason is that they are trying to rebalance their situation. As long as they live with the consequences of your mistakes, their lives are not bal- anced. They feel as if they are carrying on their shoulders a burden that you should own. They are living with your responsibilities. They do not like it. They want to reach an equilibrium in which each side lives with the con- sequences of its deeds. They are asking you to assume responsibility. Offer- ing a fake “sorry” will not cut it, or even a sincere “sorry.” It will actually reinforce their feeling of imbalance and living with the consequences of something they did not do or should not be responsible for.\n</source>\n\n\n<source id=\"doc_8\" name=\"doc_8\">\nBusiness:\tI’m\tsorry\tyou’re\tunhappy,\tand\twould\tlike\tto\thelp\tif\tpossible.
